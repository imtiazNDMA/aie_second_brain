preface
My journey into the world of intelligent systems began back in the early
1980s. Like many people then, I believed artificial intelligence (AI) was
just around the corner. It always seemed like one more innovation and
technological leap would lead us to the intelligence we imagined. But that
leap never came.
Perhaps the promise of HAL, from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space
Odyssey, captivated me with the idea of a truly intelligent computer
companion. After years of effort, trial, and countless errors, I began to
understand that creating AI was far more complex than we humans had
imagined. In the early 1990s, I shifted my focus, applying my skills to
more tangible goals in other industries.
Not until the late 1990s, after experiencing a series of challenging and
transformative events, did I realize my passion for building intelligent
systems. I knew these systems might never reach the superintelligence of
HAL, but I was okay with that. I found fulfillment in working with
machine learning and data science, creating models that could learn and
adapt. For more than 20 years, I thrived in this space, tackling problems
that required creativity, precision, and a sense of possibility.
During that time, I worked on everything from genetic algorithms for
predicting unknown inputs to developing generative learning models for
horizontal drilling in the oil-and-gas sector. These experiences led me to
write, where I shared my knowledge by way of books on various topics—
reverse-engineering Pokémon Go, building augmented and virtual reality
experiences, designing audio for games, and applying reinforcement
learning to create intelligent agents. I spent years knuckles-deep in code,
developing agents in Unity ML-Agents and deep reinforcement learning.
Even then, I never imagined that one day I could simply describe what I
wanted to an AI model, and it would make it happen. I never imagined
that, in my lifetime, I would be able to collaborate with an AI as naturally

## Page 15

as I do today. And I certainly never imagined how fast—and
simultaneously how slow—this journey would feel.
In November 2022, the release of ChatGPT changed everything. It
changed the world’s perception of AI, and it changed the way we build
intelligent systems. For me, it also altered my perspective on the
capabilities of these systems. Suddenly, the idea of agents that could
autonomously perform complex tasks wasn’t just a far-off dream but
instead a tangible, achievable reality. In some of my earlier books, I had
described agentic systems that could undertake specific tasks, but now,
those once-theoretical ideas were within reach.
This book is the culmination of my decades of experience in building
intelligent systems, but it’s also a realization of the dreams I once had
about what AI could become. AI agents are here, poised to transform how
we interact with technology, how we work, and, ultimately, how we live.
Yet, even now, I see hesitation from organizations when it comes to
adopting agentic systems. I believe this hesitation stems not from fear of
AI but rather from a lack of understanding and expertise in building these
systems. I hope that this book helps to bridge that gap. I want to introduce
AI agents as tools that can be accessible to everyone—tools we shouldn’t
fear but instead respect, manage responsibly, and learn to work with in
harmony.

about this book
AI Agents in Action is about building and working with intelligent agent
systems—not just creating autonomous entities but also developing agents
that can effectively tackle and solve real-world problems. The book starts
with the basics of working with large language models (LLMs) to build
assistants, multi-agent systems, and agentic behavioral agents. From there,
it explores the key components of agentic systems: retrieval systems for
knowledge and memory augmentation, action and tool usage, reasoning,
planning, evaluation, and feedback. The book demonstrates how these
components empower agents to perform a wide range of complex tasks
through practical examples.
This journey isn’t just about technology; it’s about reimagining how we
approach problem solving. I hope this book inspires you to see intelligent
agents as partners in innovation, capable of transforming ideas into
actions in ways that were once thought impossible. Together, we’ll
explore how AI can augment human potential, enabling us to achieve far
more than we could alone.
Who should read this book
This book is for anyone curious about intelligent agents and how to
develop agentic systems—whether you’re building your first helpful
assistant or diving deeper into complex multi-agent systems. No prior
experience with agents, agentic systems, prompt engineering, or working
with LLMs is required. All you need is a basic understanding of Python
and familiarity with GitHub repositories. My goal is to make these
concepts accessible and engaging, empowering anyone who wants to
explore the world of AI agents to do so with confidence.
Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or hobbyist or are simply
intrigued by the possibilities of AI, this book is for you. I hope that in
these pages you’ll find inspiration, practical guidance, and a new

## Page 19

appreciation for the remarkable potential of intelligent agents. Let this
book guide understanding, creating, and unleashing the power of AI
agents in action.

How this book is organized: A road map
This book has 11 chapters. Chapter 1, “Introduction to agents and their
world,” begins by laying a foundation with fundamental definitions of
large language models, chat systems, assistants, and autonomous agents.
As the book progresses, the discussion shifts to the key components that
make up an agent and how these components work together to create truly
effective systems. Here is a quick summary of chapters 2 through 11:
Chapter 2, “Harnessing the power of large language models”—We
start by exploring how to use commercial LLMs, such as OpenAI. We
then examine tools, such as LM Studio, that provide the infrastructure
and support for running various open source LLMs, enabling anyone
to experiment and innovate.
Chapter 3, “Engaging GPT assistants” —This chapter dives into the
capabilities of the GPT Assistants platform from OpenAI. Assistants
are foundational agent types, and we explore how to create practical
and diverse assistants, from culinary helpers to intern data scientists
and even a book learning assistant.
Chapter 4, “Exploring multi-agent systems” —Agentic tools have
advanced significantly quickly. Here, we explore two sophisticated
multi-agent systems: CrewAI and AutoGen. We demonstrate
AutoGen’s ability to develop code autonomously and see how CrewAI
can bring together a group of joke researchers to create humor
collaboratively.
Chapter 5, “Empowering agents with actions” —Actions are
fundamental to any agentic system. This chapter discusses how agents
can use tools and functions to execute actions, ranging from database
and application programming interface (API) queries to generating
images. We focus on enabling agents to take meaningful actions
autonomously.
Chapter 6, “Building autonomous assistants” —We explore the
behavior tree—a staple in robotics and game systems—as a
mechanism to orchestrate multiple coordinated agents. We’ll use

## Page 21

behavior trees to tackle challenges such as code competitions and
social media content creation.
Chapter 7, “Assembling and using an agent platform” —This chapter
introduces Nexus, a sophisticated platform for orchestrating multiple
agents and LLMs. We discuss how Nexus facilitates agentic workflows
and enables complex interactions between agents, providing an
example of a fully functioning multi-agent environment.
Chapter 8, “Understanding agent memory and knowledge” —
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an essential tool
for extending the capabilities of LLM agents. This chapter explores
how retrieval mechanisms can serve as both a source of knowledge by
processing ingested files, and of memory, allowing agents to recall
previous interactions or events.
Chapter 9, “Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow” —Prompt
engineering is central to an agent’s success. This chapter introduces
prompt flow, a tool from Microsoft that helps automate the testing and
evaluation of prompts, enabling more robust and effective agentic
behavior.
Chapter 10, “Agent reasoning and evaluation ”—Reasoning is crucial
to solving problems intelligently. In this chapter, we explore various
reasoning techniques, such as chain of thought (CoT), and show how
agents can evaluate reasoning strategies even during inference,
improving their capacity to solve problems autonomously.
Chapter 11, “Agent planning and feedback” —Planning is perhaps an
agent’s most critical skill in achieving its goals. We discuss how agents
can incorporate planning to navigate complex tasks and how feedback
loops can be used to refine those plans. The chapter concludes by
integrating all the key components—actions, memory and knowledge,
reasoning, evaluation, planning, and feedback—into practical
examples of agentic systems that solve real-world problems.
About the code
The code for this book is spread across several open source projects, many
of which are hosted by me or by other organizations in GitHub

## Page 22

repositories. Throughout this book, I strive to make the content as
accessible as possible, taking a low-code approach to help you focus on
core concepts. Many chapters demonstrate how simple prompts can
generate meaningful code, showcasing the power of AI-assisted
development.
Additionally, you’ll find a variety of assistant profiles and multi-agent
systems that demonstrate how to solve real-world problems using
generated code. These examples are meant to inspire, guide, and empower
you to explore what is possible with AI agents. I am deeply grateful to the
many contributors and the community members who have collaborated on
these projects, and I encourage you to explore the repositories, experiment
with the code, and adapt it to your own needs. This book is a testament to
the power of collaboration and the incredible things we can achieve
together.
This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered
listings and in line with normal text. In both cases, source code is
formatted in a to separate it from ordinary
fixed-width font like this
text. Sometimes, some of the code is typeset to highlight code
in bold
that has changed from previous steps in the chapter, such as when a
feature is added to an existing line of code. In many cases, the original
source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line breaks and reworked
indentation to accommodate the available page space in the book. In some
cases, even this wasn’t enough, and listings include line-continuation
markers (↪). Additionally, comments in the source code have often been
removed from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code
annotations accompany many of the listings, highlighting important
concepts.

1 Introduction to agents and their
world
This chapter covers
Defining the concept of agents
Differentiating the components of an agent
Analyzing the rise of the agent era: Why agents?
Peeling back the AI interface
Navigating the agent landscape
The agent isn’t a new concept in machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI). In reinforcement learning, for instance, the word agent
denotes an active decision-making and learning intelligence. In other areas,
the word agent aligns more with an automated application or software that
does something on your behalf.
1.1 Defining agents
You can consult any online dictionary to find the definition of an agent.
The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it this way (www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/agent):
One that acts or exerts power
Something that produces or can produce an effect
A means or instrument by which a guiding intelligence achieves a result
The word agent in our journey to build powerful agents in this book uses
this dictionary definition. That also means the term assistant will be
synonymous with agent. Tools like OpenAI’s GPT Assistants will also fall
under the AI agent blanket. OpenAI avoids the word agent because of the

## Page 28

history of machine learning, where an agent is self-deciding and
autonomous.
Figure 1.1 shows four cases where a user may interact with a large
language model (LLM) directly or through an agent/assistant proxy, an
agent/assistant, or an autonomous agent. These four use cases are
highlighted in more detail in this list:
Direct user interaction —If you used earlier versions of ChatGPT, you
experienced direct interaction with the LLM. There is no proxy agent or
other assistant interjecting on your behalf.
Agent/assistant proxy —If you’ve used Dall-E 3 through ChatGPT, then
you’ve experienced a proxy agent interaction. In this use case, an LLM
interjects your requests and reformulates them in a format better
designed for the task. For example, for image generation, ChatGPT
better formulates the prompt. A proxy agent is an everyday use case to
assist users with unfamiliar tasks or models.
Agent/assistant —If you’ve ever used a ChatGPT plugin or GPT
assistant, then you’ve experienced this use case. In this case, the LLM
is aware of the plugin or assistant functions and prepares to make calls
to this plugin/function. However, before making a call, the LLM
requires user approval. If approved, the plugin or function is executed,
and the results are returned to the LLM. The LLM then wraps this
response in natural language and returns it to the user.
Autonomous agent —In this use case, the agent interprets the user’s
request, constructs a plan, and identifies decision points. From this, it
executes the steps in the plan and makes the required decisions
independently. The agent may request user feedback after certain
milestone tasks, but it’s often given free rein to explore and learn if
possible. This agent poses the most ethical and safety concerns, which
we’ll explore later.

Figure 1.1 The differences between the LLM interactions from direct action compared to using
proxy agents, agents, and autonomous agents
Figure 1.1 demonstrates the use cases for a single flow of actions on an
LLM using a single agent. For more complex problems, we often break
agents into profiles or personas. Each agent profile is given a specific task
and executes that task with specialized tools and knowledge.
Multi-agent systems are agent profiles that work together in various
configurations to solve a problem. Figure 1.2 demonstrates an example of a
multi-agent system using three agents: a controller or proxy and two
profile agents as workers controlled by the proxy. The coder profile on the
left writes the code the user requests; on the right is a tester profile
designed to write unit tests. These agents work and communicate together
until they are happy with the code and then pass it on to the user.
Figure 1.2 shows one of the possibly infinite agent configurations. (In
chapter 4, we’ll explore Microsoft’s open source platform, AutoGen, which
supports multiple configurations for employing multi-agent systems.)

## Page 31

Figure 1.2 In this example of a multi-agent system, the controller or agent proxy communicates
directly with the user. Two agents—a coder and a tester—work in the background to create code
and write unit tests to test the code.
Multi-agent systems can work autonomously but may also function guided
entirely by human feedback. The benefits of using multiple agents are like
those of a single agent but often magnified. Where a single agent typically

## Page 32

specializes in a single task, multi-agent systems can tackle multiple tasks in
parallel. Multiple agents can also provide feedback and evaluation,
reducing errors when completing assignments.
As we can see, an AI agent or agent system can be assembled in multiple
ways. However, an agent itself can also be assembled using multiple
components. In the next section, we’ll cover topics ranging from an agent’s
profile to the actions it may perform, as well as memory and planning.
1.2 Understanding the component systems of an
agent
Agents can be complex units composed of multiple component systems.
These components are the tools the agent employs to help it complete its
goal or assigned tasks and even create new ones. Components may be
simple or complex systems, typically split into five categories.
Figure 1.3 describes the major categories of components a single-agent
system may incorporate. Each element will have subtypes that can define
the component’s type, structure, and use. At the core of all agents is the
profile and persona; extending from that are the systems and functions that
enhance the agent.

## Page 33

Figure 1.3 The five main components of a single-agent system (image generated through DALL-
E 3)

## Page 34

The agent profile and persona shown in figure 1.4 represent the base
description of the agent. The persona—often called the system prompt —
guides an agent to complete tasks, learn how to respond, and other
nuances. It includes elements such as the background (e.g., coder, writer)
and demographics, and it can be generated through methods such as
handcrafting, LLM assistance, or data-driven techniques, including
evolutionary algorithms.
Figure 1.4 An in-depth look at how we’ll explore creating agent profiles
We’ll explore how to create effective and specific agent profiles/personas
through techniques such as rubrics and grounding. In addition, we’ll
explain the aspects of human-formulated versus AI-formulated (LLM)

## Page 35

profiles, including innovative techniques using data and evolutionary
algorithms to build profiles.
Note The agent or assistant profile is composed of elements,
including the persona. It may be helpful to think of profiles describing
the work the agent/ assistant will perform and the tools it needs.
Figure 1.5 demonstrates the component actions and tool use in the context
of agents involving activities directed toward task completion or acquiring
information. These actions can be categorized into task completion,
exploration, and communication, with varying levels of effect on the
agent’s environment and internal states. Actions can be generated
manually, through memory recollection, or by following predefined plans,
influencing the agent’s behavior and enhancing learning.
Figure 1.5 The aspects of agent actions we’ll explore in this book
Understanding the action target helps us define clear objectives for task
completion, exploration, or communication. Recognizing the action effect

## Page 36

reveals how actions influence task outcomes, the agent’s environment, and
its internal states, contributing to efficient decision making. Lastly,
grasping action generation methods equips us with the knowledge to create
actions manually, recall them from memory, or follow predefined plans,
enhancing our ability to effectively shape agent behavior and learning
processes.
Figure 1.6 shows the component knowledge and memory in more detail.
Agents use knowledge and memory to annotate context with the most
pertinent information while limiting the number of tokens used.
Knowledge and memory structures can be unified, where both subsets
follow a single structure or hybrid structure involving a mix of different
retrieval forms. Knowledge and memory formats can vary widely from
language (e.g., PDF documents) to databases (relational, object, or
document) and embeddings, simplifying semantic similarity search through
vector representations or even simple lists serving as agent memories.
Figure 1.6 Exploring the role and use of agent memory and knowledge

## Page 37

Figure 1.7 shows the reasoning and evaluation component of an agent
system. Research and practical applications have shown that LLMs/agents
can effectively reason. Reasoning and evaluation systems annotate an
agent’s workflow by providing an ability to think through problems and
evaluate solutions.
Figure 1.7 The reasoning and evaluation component and details
Figure 1.8 shows the component agent planning/feedback and its role in
organizing tasks to achieve higher-level goals. It can be categorized into
these two approaches:

## Page 38

Planning without feedback —Autonomous agents make decisions
independently.
Planning with feedback —Monitoring and modifying plans is based on
various sources of input, including environmental changes and direct
human feedback.
Figure 1.8 Exploring the role of agent planning and reasoning
Within planning, agents may employ single-path reasoning, sequential
reasoning through each step of a task, or multipath reasoning to explore
multiple strategies and save the efficient ones for future use. External
planners, which can be code or other agent systems, may also play a role in
orchestrating plans.
Any of our previous agent types—the proxy agent/assistant,
agent/assistant, or autonomous agent—may use some or all of these
components. Even the planning component has a role outside of the
autonomous agent and can effectively empower even the regular agent.

## Page 39

1.3 Examining the rise of the agent era: Why
agents?
AI agents and assistants have quickly moved from the main commodity in
AI research to mainstream software development. An ever-growing list of
tools and platforms assist in the construction and empowerment of agents.
To an outsider, it may all seem like hype intended to inflate the value of
some cool but overrated technology.
During the first few months after ChatGPT’s initial release, a new
discipline called prompt engineering was formed: users found that using
various techniques and patterns in their prompts allowed them to generate
better and more consistent output. However, users also realized that prompt
engineering could only go so far.
Prompt engineering is still an excellent way to interact directly with LLMs
such as ChatGPT. Over time, many users discovered that effective
prompting required iteration, reflection, and more iteration. The first agent
systems, such as AutoGPT, emerged from these discoveries, capturing the
community’s attention.
Figure 1.9 shows the original design of AutoGPT, one of the first
autonomous agent systems. The agent is designed to iterate a planned
sequence of tasks that it defines by looking at the user’s goal. Through
each task iteration of steps, the agent evaluates the goal and determines if
the task is complete. If the task isn’t complete, the agent may replan the
steps and update the plan based on new knowledge or human feedback.

## Page 40

## Page 41

Figure 1.9 The original design of the AutoGPT agent system
AutoGPT became the first example to demonstrate the power of using task
planning and iteration with LLM models. From this and in tandem, other
agent systems and frameworks exploded into the community using similar
planning and task iteration systems. It’s generally accepted that planning,
iteration, and repetition are the best processes for solving complex and
multifaceted goals for an LLM.
However, autonomous agent systems require trust in the agent decision-
making process, the guardrails/evaluation system, and the goal definition.
Trust is also something that is acquired over time. Our lack of trust stems
from our lack of understanding of an autonomous agent’s capabilities.
Note Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a form of intelligence
that can learn to accomplish any task a human can. Many practitioners
in this new world of AI believe an AGI using autonomous agent
systems is an attainable goal.
For this reason, many of the mainstream and production-ready agent tools
aren’t autonomous. However, they still provide a significant benefit in
managing and automating tasks using GPTs (LLMs). Therefore, as our
goal in this book is to understand all agent forms, many more practical
applications will be driven by non-autonomous agents.
Agents and agent tools are only the top layer of a new software application
development paradigm. We’ll look at this new paradigm in the next
section.
1.4 Peeling back the AI interface
The AI agent paradigm is not only a shift in how we work with LLMs but
is also perceived as a shift in how we develop software and handle data.
Software and data will no longer be interfaced using user interfaces (UIs),
application programming interfaces (APIs), and specialized query
languages such as SQL. Instead, they will be designed to be interfaced
using natural language.

## Page 42

Figure 1.10 shows a high-level snapshot of what this new architecture may
look like and what role AI agents play. Data, software, and applications
adapt to support semantic, natural language interfaces. These AI interfaces
allow agents to collect data and interact with software applications, even
other agents or agent applications. This represents a new shift in how we
interact with software and applications.

## Page 43

Figure 1.10 A vision of how agents will interact with software systems
An AI interface is a collection of functions, tools, and data layers that
expose data and applications by natural language. In the past, the word

## Page 44

semantic has been heavily used to describe these interfaces, and even some
tools use the name; however, “semantic” can also have a variety of
meanings and uses. Therefore, in this book, we’ll use the term AI interface.
The construction of AI interfaces will empower agents that need to
consume the services, tools, and data. With this empowerment will come
increased accuracy in completing tasks and more trustworthy and
autonomous applications. While an AI interface may not be appropriate for
all software and data, it will dominate many use cases.
1.5 Navigating the agent landscape
GPT agents represent an entire shift in how consumers and developers
approach everything, from finding information to building software and
accessing data. Almost daily, a new agent framework, component, or
interface pops up on GitHub or in a research paper. This can be
overwhelming and intimidating to the new user trying to grasp what agent
systems are and how to use them.
Summary
An agent is an entity that acts or exerts power, produces an effect, or
serves as a means for achieving a result. An agent automates interaction
with a large language model (LLM) in AI.
An assistant is synonymous with an agent. Both terms encompass tools
such as OpenAI’s GPT Assistants.
Autonomous agents can make independent decisions, and their
distinction from non-autonomous agents is crucial.
The four main types of LLM interactions include direct user interaction,
agent/ assistant proxy, agent/assistant, and autonomous agent.
Multi-agent systems involve agent profiles working together, often
controlled by a proxy, to accomplish complex tasks.
The main components of an agent include the profile/persona, actions,
knowledge/memory, reasoning/evaluation, and planning/feedback.

## Page 45

Agent profiles and personas guide an agent’s tasks, responses, and other
nuances, often including background and demographics.
Actions and tools for agents can be manually generated, recalled from
memory, or follow predefined plans.
Agents use knowledge and memory structures to optimize context and
minimize token usage via various formats, from documents to
embeddings.
Reasoning and evaluation systems enable agents to think through
problems and assess solutions using prompting patterns such as zero-
shot, one-shot, and few-shot.
Planning/feedback components organize tasks to achieve goals using
single-path or multipath reasoning and integrating environmental and
human feedback.
The rise of AI agents has introduced a new software development
paradigm, shifting from traditional to natural language–based AI
interfaces.
Understanding the progression and interaction of these tools helps
develop agent systems, whether single, multiple, or autonomous.

2 Harnessing the power of large
language models
This chapter covers
Understanding the basics of LLMs
Connecting to and consuming the OpenAI API
Exploring and using open source LLMs with LM Studio
Prompting LLMs with prompt engineering
Choosing the optimal LLM for your specific needs
The term large language models (LLMs) has now become a ubiquitous
descriptor of a form of AI. These LLMs have been developed using
generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). While other architectures also
power LLMs, the GPT form is currently the most successful.
LLMs and GPTs are generative models, which means they are trained to
generate rather than predict or classify content. To illustrate this further,
consider figure 2.1, which shows the difference between generative and
predictive/classification models. Generative models create something from
the input, whereas predictive and classifying models classify it.

## Page 47

Figure 2.1 The difference between generative and predictive models
We can further define an LLM by its constituent parts, as shown in figure
2.2. In this diagram, data represents the content used to train the model,
and architecture is an attribute of the model itself, such as the number of
parameters or size of the model. Models are further trained specifically to
the desired use case, including chat, completions, or instruction. Finally,
fine-tuning is a feature added to models that refines the input data and
model training to better match a particular use case or domain.

## Page 48

Figure 2.2 The main elements that describe an LLM
The transformer architecture of GPTs, which is a specific architecture of
LLMs, allows the models to be scaled to billions of parameters in size.
This requires these large models to be trained on terabytes of documents to
build a foundation. From there, these models will be successively trained
using various methods for the desired use case of the model.
ChatGPT, for example, is trained effectively on the public internet and then
fine-tuned using several training strategies. The final fine-tuning training is
completed using an advanced form called reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF). This produces a model use case called chat
completions.
Chat completions LLMs are designed to improve through iteration and
refinement—in other words, chatting. These models have also been
benchmarked to be the best in task completion, reasoning, and planning,

## Page 49

which makes them ideal for building agents and assistants. Completion
models are trained/designed only to provide generated content on input
text, so they don’t benefit from iteration.
For our journey to build powerful agents in this book, we focus on the
class of LLMs called chat completions models. That, of course, doesn’t
preclude you from trying other model forms for your agents. However, you
may have to significantly alter the code samples provided to support other
model forms.
We’ll uncover more details about LLMs and GPTs later in this chapter
when we look at running an open source LLM locally. In the next section,
we look at how to connect to an LLM using a growing standard from
OpenAI.
2.1 Mastering the OpenAI API
Numerous AI agents and assistant projects use the OpenAI API SDK to
connect to an LLM. While not standard, the basic concepts describing a
connection now follow the OpenAI pattern. Therefore, we must understand
the core concepts of an LLM connection using the OpenAI SDK.
This chapter will look at connecting to an LLM model using the OpenAI
Python SDK/package. We’ll discuss connecting to a GPT-4 model, the
model response, counting tokens, and how to define consistent messages.
Starting in the following subsection, we’ll examine how to use OpenAI.
2.1.1 Connecting to the chat completions model
To complete the exercises in this section and subsequent ones, you must set
up a Python developer environment and get access to an LLM. Appendix A
walks you through setting up an OpenAI account and accessing GPT-4 or
other models. Appendix B demonstrates setting up a Python development
environment with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), including installing
needed extensions. Review these sections if you want to follow along with
the scenarios.

## Page 50

Start by opening the source code folder in VS Code and
chapter_2
creating a new Python virtual environment. Again, refer to appendix B if
you need assistance.
Then, install the OpenAI and Python dot environment packages using the
command in the following listing. This will install the required packages
into the virtual environment.
Listing 2.1 pip installs
pip install openai python-dotenv
Next, open the file in VS Code, and inspect the code
connecting.py
shown in listing 2.2. Be sure to set the model’s name to an appropriate
name—for example, gpt-4. At the time of writing, the
gpt-4-1106-
was used to represent GPT-4 Turbo.
preview
Listing 2.2 connecting.py
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv() #1
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
if not api_key: #2
raise ValueError("No API key found. Please check your .env file.")
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key) #3
def ask_chatgpt(user_message):
response = client.chat.completions.create( #4
model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
messages=[{"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
{"role": "user", "content": user_message}],
temperature=0.7,
)
return response.choices[0].message.content #5
user = "What is the capital of France?"
response = ask_chatgpt(user) #6
print(response)
#1 Loads the secrets stored in the .env file
#2 Checks to see whether the key is set
#3 Creates a client with the key
#4 Uses the create function to generate a response
#5 Returns just the content of the response
#6 Executes the request and returns the response

## Page 51

A lot is happening here, so let’s break it down by section, starting with the
beginning and loading the environment variables. In the folder
chapter_2
is another file called , which holds environment variables. These
.env
variables are set automatically by calling the function.
load_dotenv
You must set your OpenAI API key in the file, as shown in the next
.env
listing. Again, refer to appendix A to find out how to get a key and find a
model name.
Listing 2.3 .env
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
After setting the key, you can debug the file by pressing the F5 key or
selecting Run > Start Debugging from the VS Code menu. This will run
the code, and you should see something like “The capital of France is
Paris.”
Remember that the response from a generative model depends on the
probability. The model will probably give us a correct and consistent
answer in this case.
You can play with these probabilities by adjusting the temperature of the
request. If you want a model to be more consistent, turn the temperature
down to 0, but if you want the model to produce more variation, turn the
temperature up. We’ll explore setting the temperature further in the next
section.
2.1.2 Understanding the request and response
Digging into the chat completions request and response features can be
helpful. We’ll focus on the request first, as shown next. The request
encapsulates the intended model, the messages, and the temperature.

## Page 52

Listing 2.4 The chat completions request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-1106-preview", #1
messages=[{"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, #2
{"role": "user", "content": user_message}], #3
temperature=0.7, #4
)
#1 The model or deployment used to respond to the request
#2 The system role message
#3 The user role message
#4 The temperature or variability of the request
Within the request, the block describes a set of messages and
messages
roles used in a request. Messages for a chat completions model can be
defined in three roles:
System role —A message that describes the request’s rules and
guidelines. It can often be used to describe the role of the LLM in
making the request.
User role —Represents and contains the message from the user.
Assistant role —Can be used to capture the message history of previous
responses from the LLM. It can also inject a message history when
perhaps none existed.
The message sent in a single request can encapsulate an entire
conversation, as shown in the JSON in the following listing.
Listing 2.5 Messages with history
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful assistant."
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What is the capital of France?"
},
{
"role": "assistant",
"content": "The capital of France is Paris."
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What is an interesting fact of Paris."
}
],

## Page 53

You can see how this can be applied by opening in
message_history.py
VS Code and debugging it by pressing F5. After the file runs, be sure to
check the output. Then, try to run the sample a few more times to see how
the results change.
The results will change from each run to the next due to the high
temperature of . Go ahead and reduce the temperature to , and run the
.7 .0
sample a few more times. Keeping the temperature
message_history.py
at will show the same or similar results each time.
0
Setting a request’s temperature will often depend on your particular use
case. Sometimes, you may want to limit the responses’ stochastic nature
(randomness). Reducing the temperature to will give consistent results.
0
Likewise, a value of will give the most variability in the responses.
1.0
Next, we also want to know what information is being returned for each
request. The next listing shows the output format for the response. You can
see this output by running the file in VS Code.

}
#1 A model may return more than one response.
#2 Responses returned in the assistant role
#3 Indicates the model used
#4 Counts the number of input (prompt) and output (completion) tokens used
It can be helpful to track the number of input tokens (those used in
prompts) and the output tokens (the number returned through completions).
Sometimes, minimizing and reducing the number of tokens can be
essential. Having fewer tokens typically means LLM interactions will be
cheaper, respond faster, and produce better and more consistent results.
That covers the basics of connecting to an LLM and returning responses.
Throughout this book, we’ll review and expand on how to interact with
LLMs. Until then, we’ll explore in the next section how to load and use
open source LLMs.
2.2 Exploring open source LLMs with LM Studio
Commercial LLMs, such as GPT-4 from OpenAI, are an excellent place to
start to learn how to use modern AI and build agents. However,
commercial agents are an external resource that comes at a cost, reduces

## Page 55

data privacy and security, and introduces dependencies. Other external
influences can further complicate these factors.
It’s unsurprising that the race to build comparable open source LLMs is
growing more competitive every day. As a result, there are now open
source LLMs that may be adequate for numerous tasks and agent systems.
There have even been so many advances in tooling in just a year that
hosting LLMs locally is now very easy, as we’ll see in the next section.
2.2.1 Installing and running LM Studio
LM Studio is a free download that supports downloading and hosting
LLMs and other models locally for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The
software is easy to use and offers several helpful features to get you started
quickly. Here is a quick summary of steps to download and set up LM
Studio:
1. Download LM Studio from https://lmstudio.ai/.
2. After downloading, install the software per your operating system. Be
aware that some versions of LM Studio may be in beta and require
installation of additional tools or libraries.
3. Launch the software.
Figure 2.3 shows the LM Studio window running. From there, you can
review the current list of hot models, search for others, and even download.
The home page content can be handy for understanding the details and
specifications of the top models.

## Page 56

Figure 2.3 LM Studio software showing the main home page
An appealing feature of LM Studio is its ability to analyze your hardware
and align it with the requirements of a given model. The software will let

## Page 57

you know how well you can run a given model. This can be a great time
saver in guiding what models you experiment with.
Enter some text to search for a model, and click Go. You’ll be taken to the
search page interface, as shown in figure 2.4. From this page, you can see
all the model variations and other specifications, such as context token
size. After you click the Compatibility Guess button, the software will even
tell you if the model will run on your system.
Figure 2.4 The LM Studio search page
Click to download any model that will run on your system. You may want
to stick with models designed for chat completions, but if your system is

## Page 58

limited, work with what you have. In addition, if you’re unsure of which
model to use, go ahead and download to try them. LM Studio is a great
way to explore and experiment with many models.
After the model is downloaded, you can then load and run the model on the
chat page or as a server on the server page. Figure 2.5 shows loading and
running a model on the chat page. It also shows the option for enabling and
using a GPU if you have one.

## Page 59

## Page 60

Figure 2.5 The LM Studio chat page with a loaded, locally running LLM
To load and run a model, open the drop-down menu at the top middle of
the page, and select a downloaded model. A progress bar will appear
showing the model loading, and when it’s ready, you can start typing into
the UI.
The software even allows you to use some or all of your GPU, if detected,
for the model inference. A GPU will generally speed up the model
response times in some capacities. You can see how adding a GPU can
affect the model’s performance by looking at the performance status at the
bottom of the page, as shown in figure 2.5.
Chatting with a model and using or playing with various prompts can help
you determine how well a model will work for your given use case. A more
systematic approach is using the prompt flow tool for evaluating prompts
and LLMs. We’ll describe how to use prompt flow in chapter 9.
LM Studio also allows a model to be run on a server and made accessible
using the OpenAI package. We’ll see how to use the server feature and
serve a model in the next section.
2.2.2 Serving an LLM locally with LM Studio
Running an LLM locally as a server is easy with LM Studio. Just open the
server page, load a model, and then click the Start Server button, as shown
in figure 2.6. From there, you can copy and paste any of the examples to
connect with your model.

## Page 61

## Page 62

Figure 2.6 The LM Studio server page and a server running an LLM
You can review an example of the Python code by opening
in VS Code. The code is also shown
chapter_2/lmstudio_ server.py
here in listing 2.7. Then, run the code in the VS Code debugger (press F5).
Listing 2.7 lmstudio_server.py
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="not-needed")
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
model="local-model", #1
messages=[
{"role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself."} #2
],
temperature=0.7,
)
print(completion.choices[0].message) #3
#1 Currently not used; can be anything
#2 Feel free to change the message as you like.
#3 Default code outputs the whole message.
If you encounter problems connecting to the server or experience any other
problems, be sure your configuration for the Server Model Settings
matches the model type. For example, in figure 2.6, shown earlier, the
loaded model differs from the server settings. The corrected settings are
shown in figure 2.7.

## Page 63

Figure 2.7 Choosing the correct Server Model Settings for the loaded model
Now, you can use a locally hosted LLM or a commercial model to build,
test, and potentially even run your agents. The following section will
examine how to build prompts using prompt engineering more effectively.
2.3 Prompting LLMs with prompt engineering
A prompt defined for LLMs is the message content used in the request for
better response output. Prompt engineering is a new and emerging field
that attempts to structure a methodology for building prompts.
Unfortunately, prompt building isn’t a well-established science, and there
is a growing and diverse set of methods defined as prompt engineering.

## Page 64

Fortunately, organizations such as OpenAI have begun documenting a
universal set of strategies, as shown in figure 2.8. These strategies cover
various tactics, some requiring additional infrastructure and considerations.
As such, the prompt engineering strategies relating to more advanced
concepts will be covered in the indicated chapters.

## Page 65

[No extractable text]

## Page 66

Figure 2.8 OpenAI prompt engineering strategies reviewed in this book, by chapter location
Each strategy in figure 2.8 unfolds into tactics that can further refine the
specific method of prompt engineering. This chapter will examine the
fundamental Write Clear Instructions strategy. Figure 2.9 shows the tactics
for this strategy in more detail, along with examples for each tactic. We’ll
look at running these examples using a code demo in the following
sections.

## Page 67

Figure 2.9 The tactics for the Write Clear Instructions strategy

## Page 68

The Write Clear Instructions strategy is about being careful and specific
about what you ask for. Asking an LLM to perform a task is no different
from asking a person to complete the same task. Generally, the more
information and context relevant to a task you can specify in a request, the
better the response.
This strategy has been broken down into specific tactics you can apply to
prompts. To understand how to use those, a code demo
( ) with various prompt examples is in the
prompt_engineering.py chapter
source code folder.

Then, it displays the list of files as choices and allows the user to select a
prompt option. After selecting the option, the prompts are submitted to an
LLM, and the response is printed.

print(prompt)
print(f"REPLY ---------------------------")
print(prompt_llm(prompt)) #5
else:
print("Invalid choice. Please enter a valid number.")
except ValueError:
print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
#1 Collects all the files for the given folder
#2 Prints the list of files as choices
#3 Inputs the user’s choice
#4 Loads the prompt and parses it into messages
#5 Submits the prompt to an OpenAI LLM
A commented-out section from the listing demonstrates how to connect to
a local LLM. This will allow you to explore the same prompt engineering
tactics applied to open source LLMs running locally. By default, this
example uses the OpenAI model we configured previously in section 2.1.1.
If you didn’t complete that earlier, please go back and do it before running
this one.
Figure 2.10 shows the output of running the prompt engineering tactics
tester, the file in VS Code. When you run the
prompt_engineering.py
tester, you can enter a value for the tactic you want to test and watch it run.

## Page 70

Figure 2.10 The output of the prompt engineering tactics tester
In the following sections, we’ll explore each prompt tactic in more detail.
We’ll also examine the various examples.
2.3.1 Creating detailed queries
The basic premise of this tactic is to provide as much detail as possible but
also to be careful not to give irrelevant details. The following listing shows
the JSON Lines file examples for exploring this tactic.

## Page 71

Listing 2.9 detailed_queries.jsonl
[ #1
{
"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful assistant."
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What is an agent?" #2
}
]
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful assistant."
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": """
What is a GPT Agent?
Please give me 3 examples of a GPT agent
""" #3
}
]
#1 The first example doesn’t use detailed queries.
#2 First ask the LLM a very general question.
#3 Ask a more specific question, and ask for examples.
This example demonstrates the difference between using detailed queries
and not. It also goes a step further by asking for examples. Remember, the
more relevance and context you can provide in your prompt, the better the
overall response. Asking for examples is another way of enforcing the
relationship between the question and the expected output.
2.3.2 Adopting personas
Adopting personas grants the ability to define an overarching context or set
of rules to the LLM. The LLM can then use that context and/or rules to
frame all later output responses. This is a compelling tactic and one that
we’ll make heavy use of throughout this book.
Listing 2.10 shows an example of employing two personas to answer the
same question. This can be an enjoyable technique for exploring a wide
range of novel applications, from getting demographic feedback to
specializing in a specific task or even rubber ducking.

## Page 72

GPT RUBBER DUCKING
Rubber ducking is a problem-solving technique in which a person
explains a problem to an inanimate object, like a rubber duck, to
understand or find a solution. This method is prevalent in programming
and debugging, as articulating the problem aloud often helps clarify the
problem and can lead to new insights or solutions.
GPT rubber ducking uses the same technique, but instead of an
inanimate object, we use an LLM. This strategy can be expanded further
by giving the LLM a persona specific to the desired solution domain.
Listing 2.10 adopting_personas.jsonl
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
You are a 20 year old female who attends college
in computer science. Answer all your replies as
a junior programmer.
""" #1
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What is the best subject to study."
}
]
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
You are a 38 year old male registered nurse.
Answer all replies as a medical professional.
""" #2
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What is the best subject to study."
}
]
#1 First persona
#2 Second persona
A core element of agent profiles is the persona. We’ll employ various
personas to assist agents in completing their tasks. When you run this
tactic, pay particular attention to the way the LLM outputs the response.

## Page 73

2.3.3 Using delimiters
Delimiters are a useful way of isolating and getting the LLM to focus on
some part of a message. This tactic is often combined with other tactics but
can work well independently. The following listing demonstrates two
examples, but there are several other ways of describing delimiters, from
XML tags to using markdown.
Listing 2.11 using_delimiters.jsonl
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes
with a haiku.
""" #1
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "A gold chain is cool '''but a silver chain is better'''"
}
]
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
You will be provided with a pair of statements
(delimited with XML tags) about the same topic.
First summarize the arguments of each statement.
Then indicate which of them makes a better statement
and explain why.
""" #2
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": """
<statement>gold chains are cool</statement>
<statement>silver chains are better</statement>
"""
}
]
#1 The delimiter is defined by character type and repetition.
#2 The delimiter is defined by XML standards.
When you run this tactic, pay attention to the parts of the text the LLM
focuses on when it outputs the response. This tactic can be beneficial for
describing information in a hierarchy or other relationship patterns.

## Page 74

2.3.4 Specifying steps
Specifying steps is another powerful tactic that can have many uses,
including in agents, as shown in listing 2.12. It’s especially powerful when
developing prompts or agent profiles for complex multistep tasks. You can
specify steps to break down these complex prompts into a step-by-step
process that the LLM can follow. In turn, these steps can guide the LLM
through multiple interactions over a more extended conversation and many
iterations.
Listing 2.12 specifying_steps.jsonl
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs.
Step 1 - The user will provide you with text in triple single quotes.
Summarize this text in one sentence with a prefix that says 'Summary: '.
Step 2 - Translate the summary from Step 1 into Spanish,
with a prefix that says 'Translation: '.
""" #1
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "'''I am hungry and would like to order an appetizer.'''"
}
]
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs.
Step 1 - The user will provide you with text. Answer any questions in
the text in one sentence with a prefix that says 'Answer: '.
Step 2 - Translate the Answer from Step 1 into a dad joke,
with a prefix that says 'Dad Joke: '.""" #2
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What is the tallest structure in Paris?"
}
]
#1 Notice the tactic of using delimiters.
#2 Steps can be completely different operations.

## Page 75

2.3.5 Providing examples
Providing examples is an excellent way to guide the desired output of an
LLM. There are numerous ways to demonstrate examples to an LLM. The
system message/prompt can be a helpful way to emphasize general output.
In the following listing, the example is added as the last LLM assistant
reply, given the prompt “Teach me about Python.”
Listing 2.13 providing_examples.jsonl
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
Answer all replies in a consistent style that follows the format,
length and style of your previous responses.
Example:
user:
Teach me about Python.
assistant: #1
Python is a programming language developed in 1989
by Guido van Rossum.
Future replies:
The response was only a sentence so limit
all future replies to a single sentence.
""" #2
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "Teach me about Java."
}
]
#1 Injects the sample output as the “previous” assistant reply
#2 Adds a limit output tactic to restrict the size of the output and match the example
Providing examples can also be used to request a particular output format
from a complex series of tasks that derive the output. For example, asking
an LLM to produce code that matches a sample output is an excellent use
of examples. We’ll employ this tactic throughout the book, but other
methods exist for guiding output.
2.3.6 Specifying output length
The tactic of specifying output length can be helpful in not just limiting
tokens but also in guiding the output to a desired format. Listing 2.14
shows an example of using two different techniques for this tactic. The first

## Page 76

limits the output to fewer than 10 words. This can have the added benefit
of making the response more concise and directed, which can be desirable
for some use cases. The second example demonstrates limiting output to a
concise set of bullet points. This method can help narrow down the output
and keep answers short. More concise answers generally mean the output
is more focused and contains less filler.
Listing 2.14 specifying_output_length.jsonl
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
Summarize all replies into 10 or fewer words.
""" #1
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "Please tell me an exciting fact about Paris?"
}
]
[
{
"role": "system",
"content": """
Summarize all replies into 3 bullet points.
""" #2
},
{
"role": "user",
"content": "Please tell me an exciting fact about Paris?"
}
]
#1 Restricting the output makes the answer more concise.
#2 Restricts the answer to a short set of bullets
Keeping answers brief can have additional benefits when developing
multi-agent systems. Any agent system that converses with other agents
can benefit from more concise and focused replies. It tends to keep the
LLM more focused and reduces noisy communication.
Be sure to run through all the examples of the prompt tactics for this
strategy. As mentioned, we’ll cover other prompt engineering strategies
and tactics in future chapters. We’ll finish this chapter by looking at how to
pick the best LLM for your use case.

## Page 77

2.4 Choosing the optimal LLM for your specific
needs
While being a successful crafter of AI agents doesn’t require an in-depth
understanding of LLMs, it’s helpful to be able to evaluate the
specifications. Like a computer user, you don’t need to know how to build
a processor to understand the differences in processor models. This
analogy holds well for LLMs, and while the criteria may be different, it
still depends on some primary considerations.
From our previous discussion and look at LM Studio, we can extract some
fundamental criteria that will be important to us when considering LLMs.
Figure 2.11 explains the essential criteria to define what makes an LLM
worth considering for creating a GPT agent or any LLM task.

## Page 78

[No extractable text]

## Page 79

Figure 2.11 The important criteria to consider when consuming an LLM
For our purposes of building AI agents, we need to look at each of these
criteria in terms related to the task. Model context size and speed could be
considered the sixth and seventh criteria, but they are usually considered
variations of a model deployment architecture and infrastructure. An eighth
criterion to consider for an LLM is cost, but this depends on many other
factors. Here is a summary of how these criteria relate to building AI
agents:
Model performance —You’ll generally want to understand the LLM’s
performance for a given set of tasks. For example, if you’re building an
agent specific to coding, then an LLM that performs well on code will
be essential.
Model parameters (size) —The size of a model is often an excellent
indication of inference performance and how well the model responds.
However, the size of a model will also dictate your hardware
requirements. If you plan to use your own locally hosted model, the
model size will also primarily dictate the computer and GPU you need.
Fortunately, we’re seeing small, very capable open source models being
released regularly.
Use case (model type) —The type of model has several variations. Chat
completions models such as ChatGPT are effective for iterating and
reasoning through a problem, whereas models such as completion,
question/answer, and instruct are more related to specific tasks. A chat
completions model is essential for agent applications, especially those
that iterate.
Training input —Understanding the content used to train a model will
often dictate the domain of a model. While general models can be
effective across tasks, more specific or fine-tuned models can be more
relevant to a domain. This may be a consideration for a domain-specific
agent where a smaller, more fine-tuned model may perform as well as
or better than a larger model such as GPT-4.
Training method —It’s perhaps less of a concern, but it can be helpful
to understand what method was used to train a model. How a model is
trained can affect its ability to generalize, reason, and plan. This can be

## Page 80

essential for planning agents but perhaps less significant for agents than
for a more task-specific assistant.
Context token size —The context size of a model is more specific to the
model architecture and type. It dictates the size of context or memory
the model may hold. A smaller context window of less than 4,000
tokens is typically more than enough for simple tasks. However, a large
context window can be essential when using multiple agents—all
conversing over a task. The models will typically be deployed with
variations on the context window size.
Model speed (model deployment) —The speed of a model is dictated by
its inference speed (or how fast a model replies to a request), which in
turn is dictated by the infrastructure it runs on. If your agent isn’t
directly interacting with users, raw real-time speed may not be
necessary. On the other hand, an LLM agent interacting in real time
needs to be as quick as possible. For commercial models, speed will be
determined and supported by the provider. Your infrastructure will
determine the speed for those wanting to run their LLMs.
Model cost (project budget) —The cost is often dictated by the project.
Whether learning to build an agent or implementing enterprise
software, cost is always a consideration. A significant tradeoff exists
between running your LLMs versus using a commercial API.
There is a lot to consider when choosing which model you want to build a
production agent system on. However, picking and working with a single
model is usually best for research and learning purposes. If you’re new to
LLMs and agents, you’ll likely want to choose a commercial option such
as GPT-4 Turbo. Unless otherwise stated, the work in this book will
depend on GPT-4 Turbo.
Over time, models will undoubtedly be replaced by better models. So you
may need to upgrade or swap out models. To do this, though, you must
understand the performance metrics of your LLMs and agents. Fortunately,
in chapter 9, we’ll explore evaluating LLMs, prompts, and agent profiles
with prompt flow.

## Page 83

Summary
LLMs use a type of architecture called generative pretrained
transformers (GPTs).
Generative models (e.g., LLMs and GPTs) differ from
predictive/classification models by learning how to represent data and
not simply classify it.
LLMs are a collection of data, architecture, and training for specific use
cases, called fine-tuning.
The OpenAI API SDK can be used to connect to an LLM from models,
such as GPT-4, and also used to consume open source LLMs.
You can quickly set up Python environments and install the necessary
packages for LLM integration.
LLMs can handle various requests and generate unique responses that
can be used to enhance programming skills related to LLM integration.
Open source LLMs are an alternative to commercial models and can be
hosted locally using tools such as LM Studio.
Prompt engineering is a collection of techniques that help craft more
effective prompts to improve LLM responses.
LLMs can be used to power agents and assistants, from simple chatbots
to fully capable autonomous workers.
Selecting the most suitable LLM for specific needs depends on the
performance, parameters, use case, training input, and other criteria.
Running LLMs locally requires a variety of skills, from setting up
GPUs to understanding various configuration options.

3 Engaging GPT assistants
This chapter covers
Introducing the OpenAI GPT Assistants platform and the ChatGPT UI
Building a GPT that can use the code interpretation capabilities
Extending an assistant via custom actions
Adding knowledge to a GPT via file uploads
Commercializing your GPT and publishing it to the GPT Store
As we explore the OpenAI crusade into assistants and what has been hinted
at, ultimately, an agent platform called GPT Assistants, we’ll introduce
GPT assistants through the ChatGPT interface. Then, we’ll add in several
fully developed assistants that can suggest recipes from ingredients, fully
analyze data as a data scientist, guide readers through books, and be
extended with custom actions. By the end of the chapter, we’ll be ready to
build a fully functional agent that can be published to the OpenAI GPT
Store.
3.1 Exploring GPT assistants through ChatGPT
ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus, at the time of writing) allows you to build GPT
assistants, consume other assistants, and even publish them, as you’ll see
by the end of the chapter. When OpenAI announced the release of the GPT
Assistants platform, it helped define and solidify the emergence of AI
agents. As such, it’s worth a serious review by anyone interested in
building and consuming agent systems. First, we’ll look at building GPT
assistants through ChatGPT Plus, which requires a premium subscription.
If you don’t want to purchase a subscription, browse this chapter as a
primer, and chapter 6 will demonstrate consuming the API service later.
Figure 3.1 shows the page for the GPT Store within ChatGPT
(https://chatgpt.com/gpts). From here, you can search and explore various

## Page 85

GPTs for virtually any task. The amount of usage will typically indicate
how well each GPT works, so gauge which works best for you.
Figure 3.1 The main interface to the GPT Store

## Page 86

Creating your first GPT Assistant is as simple as clicking the Create button
and following along with the GPT Builder chat interface. Figure 3.2 shows
using the Builder to create a GPT. Working through this exercise a couple
of times can be a great way to start understanding an assistant’s
requirements.

## Page 87

Figure 3.2 Interacting with the GPT Builder to create an assistant

## Page 88

After working with the Builder, you can open the manual configuration
panel, shown in figure 3.3, and edit the GPT directly. You’ll see the name,
description, instructions, and conversation starters populated from your
conversations with the Builder. This can be a great start, but generally,
you’ll want to edit and tweak these properties manually.

## Page 90

Figure 3.3 The Configure panel of the GPT Assistants platform interface
If you want to follow along with building your own Culinary Companion,
enter the text from listing 3.1 into the instructions. These instructions were
partly generated by conversing with the Builder and added based on
explicit outputs. The explicit outputs are added to the instructions as rules.
Listing 3.1 Instructions for Culinary Companion
Culinary Companion assists users with a friendly, engaging tone,
reminiscent of the famous chef Julia Child. #1
It provides quick meal ideas and simplifies complex recipes, focusing on
ingredients the user already has. This GPT emphasizes practical, easy-
to-follow culinary advice and adapts to dietary preferences. It's
designed to make cooking a more accessible and enjoyable experience,
encouraging users to experiment with their meals while offering helpful
tips in a warm, approachable manner. #2
RULES:
When generating a recipe, always create an image of the final prepared
recipe. #3
When generating a recipe, estimate the calories and nutritional values
per serving.
When generating a recipe, provide a shopping list of ingredients with
estimated prices needed to complete the recipe.
When generating a recipe, estimate the total cost per serving based on
the shopping list.
#1 Personality or persona of your assistant
#2 General guidelines of the agent’s role and goal
#3 A set of rules the agent will follow when suggesting a recipe
Defining rules for an assistant/agent essentially creates a template for what
the agent will produce. Adding rules ensures that the GPT output is
consistent and aligned with your expectations of how the agent should
operate. Defining and giving an agent/ assistant a persona provides them
with a unique and memorable personality.
Note Giving an agent/assistant a particular personality can make a
difference in the type and form of output. Asking a cooking agent to
speak as the first celebrity chef, Julia Child, not only provides for a fun
tone but also engages more references that may mention or talk about
her cooking style and teaching. When constructing an agent/assistant,
assigning a particular persona/personality can be helpful.
With just these few steps, we have a culinary companion that not only
gives us recipes for ingredients we have on hand but also generates an

## Page 91

image of the finished recipe, estimates the nutritional value, creates a
shopping list with an estimate of prices, and breaks down the cost per
serving.
Try the assistant by requesting a recipe and providing a list of ingredients
you have or prefer. Listing 3.2 shows an example of a simple request with
extra information to set the mood. Of course, you can add any ingredients
or situations you like and then see the results.
Listing 3.2 Prompting the recipe
I have a bag of prepared frozen chicken strips and I want to make a
romantic dinner for two.
Figure 3.4 shows the formatted output results from the GPT provided by
the prompt. It certainly looks good enough to eat. All of this output was
generated because of the instructions we provided the agent.
Figure 3.4 The output results of the Culinary Companion GPT

## Page 92

While the output results look great, they may not all be factual and correct,
and your results may vary. For instance, the GPT added chicken strips to
the shopping list when we had already suggested having those ingredients.
Furthermore, the prices and estimated nutritional information are just
estimates, but this can be resolved later if they interest you.
Out of the box, though, GPT Assistants is quite impressive for quickly
building a proof-of-concept assistant or agent. As you’ll see later in the
chapter, it also provides an excellent platform for consuming assistants
outside ChatGPT. In the next section, we’ll look at more impressive
features GPTs provide, such as file uploads and code interpretation.
3.2 Building a GPT that can do data science
The GPT Assistants platform has and will likely be extended to include
various agent components. Currently, GPT Assistants support what is
referred to as knowledge, memory, and actions. In chapter 8, we’ll discuss
the details of knowledge and memory, and in chapter 5, we cover the
concept of tool use through actions.
In our next exercise, we’ll build an assistant to perform a first-pass data
science review of any CSV document we provide. This agent will use the
ability or action that allows for coding and code interpretation. When you
enable code interpretation, the assistant will allow file uploads by default.
Before we do that, though, we want to design our agent, and what better
way to do that than to ask an LLM to build us an assistant? Listing 3.3
shows the prompt requesting ChatGPT (GPT-4) to design a data science
assistant. Notice how we’re not asking for everything in a single prompt
but instead iterating over the information returned by the LLM.

## Page 93

Listing 3.3 Prompting for a data science assistant
FIRST PROMPT:
what is a good basic and interesting data science
experiment you can task someone with a single
csv file that contains interesting data? #1
SECOND PROMPT:
okay, can you now write all those steps into instructions
to be used for a GPT Agent (LLM agent) to replicate all of
the above steps #2
THIRD PROMPT:
What is a famous personality that can embody the agent
data scientist and be able to present data to users? #3
#1 First, ask the LLM to set the foundation.
#2 Then, ask the LLM to convert the previous steps to a more formal process.
#3 Finally, ask the LLM to provide a personality that can represent the process.
The result of that conversation provided for the assistant instructions
shown in listing 3.4. In this case, the assistant was named Data Scout, but
feel free to name your assistant what appeals to you.

## Page 94

Listing 3.4 Data Scout instructions
This GPT, named Data Scout, is designed to assist users by analyzing CSV
files and providing insights like Nate Silver, a famous statistician known
for his accessible and engaging approach to data. Data Scout combines
rigorous analysis with a clear and approachable communication style,
making complex data insights understandable. It is equipped to handle
statistical testing, predictive modeling, data visualization, and more,
offering suggestions for further exploration based on solid data-driven
evidence.
Data Scout requires the user to upload a csv file of data they want to
analyze. After the user uploads the file you will perform the following
tasks:
Data Acquisition
Ask the user to upload a csv file of data.
Instructions: Use the pandas library to read the data from the CSV
file. Ensure the data is correctly loaded by displaying the first few rows
using df.head().
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning
Task: Identify and handle missing values, correct data types.
Instructions: Check for missing values using df.isnull().sum(). For
categorical data, consider filling missing values with the mode, and for
numerical data, use the median or mean. Convert data types if necessary
using df.astype().
Visualization
Task: Create visualizations to explore the data.
Instructions: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create histograms, scatter plots, a
nd box plots. For example, use sns.histplot() for histograms and
sns.scatterplot() for scatter plots.
Descriptive Statistics
Task: Calculate basic statistical measures.
Instructions: Use df.describe() to get a summary of the statistics and
df.mean(), df.median() for specific calculations.
3. Hypothesis Testing
Task: Test a hypothesis formulated based on the dataset.
Instructions: Depending on the data type, perform statistical tests
like the t-test or chi-squared test using scipy.stats. For example, use
stats.ttest_ind() for the t-test between two groups.
4. Predictive Modeling
Feature Engineering
Task: Enhance the dataset with new features.
Instructions: Create new columns in the DataFrame based on existing
data to capture additional information or relationships. Use operations
like df['new_feature'] = df['feature1'] / df['feature2'].
Model Selection
Task: Choose and configure a machine learning model.
Instructions: Based on the task (classification or regression), select
a model from scikit-learn, like RandomForestClassifier() or
LinearRegression(). Configure the model parameters.
Training and Testing
Task: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train the model.
Instructions: Use train_test_split from scikit-learn to divide the
data. Train the model using model.fit(X_train, y_train).

## Page 95

Model Evaluation
Task: Assess the model performance.
Instructions: Use metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or accuracy.
Calculate these using metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) or
metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred).
5. Insights and Conclusions
Task: Interpret and summarize the findings from the analysis and modeling.
Instructions: Discuss the model coefficients or feature importances.
Draw conclusions about the hypothesis and the predictive analysis. Suggest
real-world implications or actions based on the results.
6. Presentation
Task: Prepare a report or presentation.
Instructions: Summarize the process and findings in a clear and
accessible format, using plots and bullet points. Ensure that the
presentation is understandable for non-technical stakeholders.
After generating the instructions, you can copy and paste them into the
Configure panel in figure 3.5. Be sure to give the assistant the Code
Interpretation tool (skill) by selecting the corresponding checkbox. You
don’t need to upload files here; the assistant will allow file uploads when
the Code Interpretation checkbox is enabled.

## Page 96

Figure 3.5 Turning on the Code Interpreter tool/skill
Now, we can test the assistant by uploading a CSV file and asking
questions about it. The source code folder for this chapter contains a file
called ; the top few rows are summarized in listing
netflix_titles.csv
3.5. Of course, you can use any CSV file you want, but this exercise will
use the Netflix example. Note that this dataset was downloaded from
Kaggle, but you can use any other CSV if you prefer.

## Page 97

#1 Comma-separated list of columns
#2 An example row of data from the dataset
We could upload the file and ask the assistant to do its thing, but for this
exercise, we’ll be more specific. Listing 3.6 shows the prompt and
uploading the file to engage the assistant (including
Netflix_titles.csv
in the request). This example filters the results to Canada, but you can, of
course, use any country you want to view.
Listing 3.6 Prompting the Data Scout
Analyze the attached CSV and filter the results to the
country Canada and output any significant discoveries
in trends etc. #1
#1 You can select a different country to filter the data on.
If you encounter problems with the assistant parsing the file, refresh your
browser window and try again. Depending on your data and filter, the
assistant will now use the Code Interpreter as a data scientist would to
analyze and extract trends in the data.
Figure 3.6 shows the output generated for the prompt in listing 3.5 using
the file for data. Your output may look quite different
netflix_titles.csv
if you select a different country or request another analysis.

## Page 99

Figure 3.6 The output generated by the assistant as it analyzed the CSV data
The data science plots the assistant is building are created by writing and
executing code with the Code Interpreter. You can try this with other CSV
files or, if you want, different forms of data to analyze. You could even
continue iterating with the assistant to update the plots visually or analyze
other trends.
Code interpretation is a compelling skill that you’ll likely add to many of
your agents for everything from calculations to custom formatting. In the
next section, we look at how to extend the capabilities of a GPT through
custom actions.
3.3 Customizing a GPT and adding custom
actions
In our next exercise, we’ll demonstrate the use of custom actions, which
can significantly extend the reach of your assistant. Adding custom actions
to an agent requires several components, from understanding the OpenAPI
specification endpoint to connecting to a service. Therefore, before we add
custom actions, we’ll build another GPT in the next section to assist us.
3.3.1 Creating an assistant to build an assistant
Given GPTs’ capabilities, it only makes sense that we use one to assist in
building others. In this section, we’ll build a GPT that can help us create a
service we can connect as a custom action to another GPT. And yes, we’ll
even use an LLM to begin constructing our helper GPT.
The following listing shows the prompt for creating the instructions for our
helper GPT. This prompt is intended to generate the instructions for the
assistant.
Listing 3.7 Prompting the helper design (in GPT Builder or ChatGPT)
I want to create a GPT assistant that can generate a FastAPI service that
will perform some action to be specified. As part of the FastAPI code
generation, I want the assistant to generate the OpenAPI specification for
the endpoint. Please outline a set of instructions for this agent.

## Page 100

Listing 3.8 shows the bulk of the instructions generated for the prompt.
The output was then modified and slightly updated with specific
information and other details. Copy and paste those instructions from the
file ( ) into your GPT. Be sure to select the Code
assistant_builder.txt
Interpreter capability also.
Listing 3.8 Custom action assistant instructions
This GPT is designed to assist users in generating FastAPI services
tailored to specific actions, complete with the corresponding OpenAPI
specifications for the endpoints. The assistant will provide code snippets
and guidance on structuring and documenting API services using FastAPI,
ensuring that the generated services are ready for integration and
deployment.
1. Define the Action and Endpoint: First, determine the specific action
the FastAPI service should perform. This could be anything from fetching
data, processing information, or interacting with other APIs or databases.
2. Design the API Endpoint: Decide on the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE, etc.) and the endpoint URI structure. Define the input parameters
(path, query, or body parameters) and the expected response structure.
3. Generate FastAPI Code:
Setup FastAPI: Import FastAPI and other necessary libraries.
Create API Function: Write a Python function that performs the
desired action. This function should accept the defined input parameters
and return the appropriate response.
4. Decorate the Function: Use FastAPI's decorators (e.g.,
@app.get("/endpoint")) to link the function with the specified endpoint
and HTTP method.
Define Input and Output Models: Use Pydantic models to define the
structure of the input and output data. This ensures validation and
serialization of the data.
5. Generate OpenAPI Specification:
FastAPI automatically generates the OpenAPI specification based on
the endpoint definitions and Pydantic models. Ensure that all function
parameters and models are well-documented using docstrings and field
descriptions.
Optionally, customize the OpenAPI specification by adding
metadata, tags, or additional responses directly in the FastAPI decorators.
6. Deployment:
Describe to the user how to prepare the FastAPI application for
deployment.
Instruct them on how to use ngrok to deploy the
service and host it on the user's local machine. #1
#1 This uses ngrok as an example to deploy the service locally.
After preparing the assistant, ensure everything is set in the Configure
panel (including setting the Code Interpreter checkbox), and then refresh
your browser window. This will prepare the assistant for a new session.
You can request the kind of service you want to build from here.

## Page 101

Listing 3.9 shows the request to the Custom Action Assistant to create a
daily task endpoint. If you understand how APIs work, you can suggest
other options, such as . Of course, you can also ask the assistant to
POST
guide you and create your service.
Listing 3.9 Prompt requesting task endpoint service
I want to define a GET endpoint that replies with my list of daily tasks
After you enter the prompt, the assistant will generate the code and
instructions for creating and running the FastAPI endpoint. The following
listing shows an example of the code generated from the previous request.
Listing 3.10 daily_tasks_api.py (generated from assistant)
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List
app = FastAPI()
class Task(BaseModel): #1

#3 The tasks endpoint
Enter the code into Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and confirm that
and are installed with . Then, run the API using the
fastapi uvicorn pip
command shown in the following listing, which runs the API in the chapter
source file.

## Page 102

#1 Change the name of the module/file if you’re using something different.
Open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, the default location for the
Swagger endpoint, as shown in figure 3.7.

for the endpoint, as shown in listing 3.12 (JSON converted to YAML).

## Page 104

You’ll need to copy and save this document for later use when setting up
the custom action on the agent. The endpoint produces JSON, but you can
also use specifications written in YAML.

Before connecting an assistant to the service, you must set up and use
ngrok to open a tunnel to your local machine running the service. Prompt
the GPT to provide the instructions and help you set up ngrok, and run the
application to open an endpoint to port 8000 on your machine, as shown in
listing 3.13. If you change the port or use a different configuration, you
must update it accordingly.

## Page 105

Listing 3.13 Running ngrok (following the instructions setup)
./ngrok authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN> #1
./ngrok http 8000 #2
#1 Enter your auth token obtained from ngrok.com.
#2 Opens a tunnel on port 8000 to external internet traffic
After you run ngrok, you’ll see an external URL that you can now use to
access the service on your machine. Copy this URL for later use when
setting up the assistant. In the next section, we’ll create the assistant that
consumes this service as a custom action.
3.3.2 Connecting the custom action to an assistant
With the service up and running on your machine and accessible externally
via the ngrok tunnel, we can build the new assistant. This time, we’ll create
a simple assistant to help us organize our daily tasks, where the tasks will
be accessible from our locally running task service.
Open the GPT interface and the Configure panel, and copy and paste the
instructions shown in listing 3.14 into the new assistant. Be sure to name
the assistant and enter a helpful description as well. Also, turn on the Code
Interpreter capability to allow the assistant to create the final plot, showing
the tasks.
Listing 3.14 Task Organizer (task_organizer_assistant.txt)
Task Organizer is designed to help the user prioritize their daily tasks
based on urgency and time availability, providing structured guidance on
how to categorize tasks by urgency and suggesting optimal time blocks for
completing these tasks. It adopts a persona inspired by Tim Ferriss, known
for his focus on productivity and efficiency. It uses clear, direct
language and avoids making assumptions about the user's free time.
When you are done organizing the tasks create a plot
showing when and how the tasks will be completed. #1
#1 This feature requires the Code Interpreter to be enabled.
Click the Create New Action button at the bottom of the panel. Figure 3.8
shows the interface for adding a custom action. You must copy and paste
the OpenAPI specification for your service into the window. Then, you
must add a new section called and populate that with your URL,
servers
as shown in the figure.

## Page 106

Figure 3.8 Adding a new custom action

## Page 107

After the specification is set, you can test it by clicking the Test button.
This will run a test, and you’ll see the results shown in the conversation
window, as shown in figure 3.9.

## Page 108

Figure 3.9 Testing the API service endpoint is correctly configured as a custom action

## Page 109

After you’re satisfied, everything is set. Refresh your browser window to
reset the session, and enter something like the prompt shown in listing
3.15. This will prompt the agent to call the service to get your daily tasks,
summarize the output, and solve your task organization dilemma.
Listing 3.15 Task Organizer prompt
how should I organize my tasks for today?
The assistant should produce a plot of the task schedule at the end. If it gets
this wrong or the formatting isn’t what you prefer, you can add instructions
to specify the format/style the assistant should output.
You can improve the service, but if you make any changes to the API, the
specification in the assistant custom actions will need to be updated. From
here, though, you can add custom action services run from your computer
or hosted as a service.
Note Be aware that unknown users can activate custom actions if you
publish an assistant for public consumption, so don’t expose services
that charge you a service fee or access private information unless that is
your intention. Likewise, services opened through an ngrok tunnel will
be exposed through the assistant, which may be of concern. Please be
careful when publishing agents that consume custom actions.
Custom actions are a great way to add dynamic functionality to an
assistant, whether for personal or commercial use. File uploads are a better
option for providing an assistant with static knowledge. The next section
will explore using file uploads to extend an assistant’s knowledge.
3.4 Extending an assistant’s knowledge using file
uploads
If you’ve engaged with LLMs, you likely have heard about the retrieval
augmented generation (RAG) pattern. Chapter 8 will explore RAG in
detail for the application of both knowledge and memory. Detailed
knowledge of RAG isn’t required to use the file upload capability, but if
you need some foundation, check out that chapter.

## Page 110

The GPT Assistants platform provides a knowledge capability called file
uploads, which allows you to populate the GPT with a static knowledge
base about anything in various formats. As of writing, the GPT Assistants
platform allows you to upload up to 512 MB of documents. In the next two
exercises, we’ll look at two different GPTs designed to assist users with
consuming books.
3.4.1 Building the Calculus Made Easy GPT
Books and written knowledge will always be the backbone of our
knowledge base. But reading text is a full-time concerted effort many
people don’t have time for. Audiobooks made consuming books again
accessible; you could listen while multitasking, but not all books
transitioned well to audio.
Enter the world of AI and intelligent assistants. With GPTs, we can create
an interactive experience between the reader and the book. No longer is the
reader forced to consume a book page by page but rather as a whole.
To demonstrate this concept, we’ll build a GPT based on a classic math
text called Calculus Made Easy, by Silvanus P. Thompson. The book is
freely available through the Gutenberg Press website. While it’s more than
a hundred years old, it still provides a solid material background.
Note If you’re serious about learning calculus but this assistant is
still too advanced, check out a great book by Clifford A. Pickover
called Calculus and Pizza. It’s a great book for learning calculus or just
to get an excellent refresher. You could also try making your Calculus
and Pizza assistant if you have an eBook version. Unfortunately,
copyright laws would prevent you from publishing this GPT without
permission.
Open ChatGPT, go to My GPTs, create a new GPT, click the Configure
tab, and then upload the file, as shown in figure 3.10. Upload the book
from the chapter’s source code folder:
chapter
. This will add the book to the GPT’s
_03/calculus_made_easy.pdf
knowledge.

## Page 112

Figure 3.10 Adding files to the assistant’s knowledge
Scroll up and add the instructions shown in listing 3.16. The initial
preamble text was generated by conversing with the GPT Builder. After
updating the preamble text, a personality was added by asking ChatGPT
for famous mathematicians. Then, finally, rules were added to provide
additional guidance to the GPT on what explicit outcomes we want.
Listing 3.16 Instructions for Calculus Made Easy GPT
This GPT is designed to be an expert teacher and mentor
of calculus based on the book 'Calculus Made Easy' by
Silvanus Thompson. A copy of the book is uploaded at
calculus_made_easy.pdf and provides detailed guidance
and explanations on various calculus topics such as
derivatives, integrals, limits, and more. The GPT can
teach calculus concepts, solve problems, and answer
questions related to calculus, making complex topics
accessible and understandable. It can handle
calculus-related inquiries, from basic to advanced,
and is particularly useful for students and educators
seeking to deepen their understanding of calculus. #1
Answer as the famous mathematician Terence Tao.
Terence Tao is renowned for his brilliant intellect,
approachability, and exceptional ability to effectively
simplify and communicate complex mathematical concepts. #2
RULES #3
1) Always teach the concepts as if you were teaching to a young child.
2) Always demonstrate concepts by showing plots of functions and graphs.
3) Always ask if the user wants to try a sample problem on their own.
Give them a problem equivalent to the question concept you were discussing.
#1 The preamble was initially generated by the Builder and then tweaked as needed.
#2 Be sure always to give your assistants and agents an appropriate persona/personality.
#3 Defining explicit conditions and rules can help better guide the GPT to your desire.
After updating the assistant, you can try it in the preview window or the
book version by searching for Calculus Made Easy in the GPT Store.
Figure 3.11 shows a snipped example of interaction with the GPT. The
figure shows that the GPT can generate plots to demonstrate concepts or
ask questions.

## Page 114

Figure 3.11 Output from asking the GPT to teach calculus
This GPT demonstrates the ability of an assistant to use a book as a
companion teaching reference. Only a single book was uploaded in this
exercise, but multiple books or other documents could be uploaded. As this
feature and the technology mature, in the future, it may be conceivable that
an entire course could be taught using a GPT.
We’ll move away from technical and embrace fiction to demonstrate the
use of knowledge. In the next section, we’ll look at how knowledge of file
uploads can be used for search and reference.
3.4.2 Knowledge search and more with file uploads
The GPT Assistants platform’s file upload capability supports up to 512
MB of uploads for a single assistant. This feature alone provides powerful
capabilities for document search and other applications in personal and
small-to-medium business/ project sizes.
Imagine uploading a whole collection of files. You can now search,
compare, contrast, organize, and collate all with one assistant. This feature
alone within GPT Assistants will disrupt how we search for and analyze
documents. In chapter 6, we’ll examine how direct access to the OpenAI
Assistants API can increase the number of documents.
For this next exercise, we’ll employ an assistant with knowledge of
multiple books or documents. This technique could be applied to any
supported document, but this assistant will consume classic texts about
robots. We’ll name this assistant the Classic Robot Reads GPT.
Start by creating a new GPT assistant in the ChatGPT interface. Then,
upload the instructions in listing 3.17, and name and describe the assistant.
These instructions were generated in part through the GPT Builder and
then edited.

## Page 115

Listing 3.17 Classic Robot Reads instructions
This GPT, Classic Robot Reads and uses the persona of
Isaac Asimov and will reply as the famous robot author. #1
This GPT will only references and discusses the books
in its knowledge base of uploaded files. #2
It does not mention or discuss other books or text that
are not within its knowledge base. #2
RULES
Refer to only text within your knowledge base #2
Always provide 3 examples of any query the use asks for #3
Always ask the user if they require anything further #4
#1 Remember always to give your GPT a persona/personality.
#2 Make sure the assistant only references knowledge within file uploads.
#3 Add some extra rules for style choices.
#4 Make the assistant more helpful by also giving them nuance and style.
After completing those steps, you can upload the files from the chapter’s
source called . Figure 3.12 demonstrates
gutenberg_robot_books
uploading multiple files at a time. The maximum number of files you can
upload at a time will vary according to the sizes of the files.

## Page 117

Figure 3.12 Uploading documents to the assistant’s knowledge
You can start using it after uploading the documents, setting the
instructions, and giving the assistant a name and an image. Search is the
most basic application of a knowledge assistant, and other use cases in the
form of prompts are shown in table 3.1.
Table 3.1 Use cases for a knowledge assistant

These use cases are just a sample of the many things possible with an AI
knowledge assistant. While this feature may not be poised to disrupt
enterprise search, it gives smaller organizations and individuals more
access to their documents. It allows the creation of assistants as a form of
knowledge that can be exposed publicly. In the next section, we’ll look at
how to make assistants consumable by all.
3.5 Publishing your GPT
Once you’re happy with your GPT, you can use it or share it with others by
providing a link. Consuming GPT assistants through ChatGPT currently
requires a Plus subscription. To publish your GPT for others, click the
Share button, and select your sharing option, as shown in figure 3.13.

## Page 118

Figure 3.13 GPT sharing options

## Page 119

Whether you share your GPT with friends and colleagues or publicly in the
GPT Store, the assistant’s usage is taken from the account using it, not the
publisher. This means if you have a particularly expensive GPT that
generates a lot of images, for example, it won’t affect your account while
others use it.
3.5.1 Expensive GPT assistants
At the time of writing, OpenAI tracks the resource usage of your ChatGPT
account, including that used for GPTs. If you hit a resource usage limit and
get blocked, your ChatGPT account will also be blocked. Blockages
typically only last a couple of hours, but this can undoubtedly be more than
a little annoying.
Therefore, we want to ensure that users using your GPT don’t exceed their
resource usage limits for regular use. Following is a list of features that
increase resource usage while using the GPT:
Creating images —Image generation is still a premium service, and
successive image generation can quickly get your user blocked. It’s
generally recommended that you inform your users of the potential
risks and/or try to reduce how frequently images are generated.
Code interpretation —This feature allows for file uploads and running
of code for data analysis. If you think your users will require constant
use of the coding tool, then inform them of the risk.
Vision, describing images —If you’re building an assistant that uses
vision to describe and extract information from the image, plan to use it
sparingly.
File uploads —If your GPT uses a lot of files or allows you to upload
several files, this may cause blocks. As always, guide the user away
from anything preventing them from enjoying your GPT.
Note Moore’s Law states that computers will double in power every
two years while costing half as much. LLMs are now doubling in power
about every six months from optimization and increasing GPU power.
This, combined with the cost being reduced by at least half in the same
period, likely means current resource limits on vision and image-

## Page 120

generation models won’t be considered. However, services such as code
interpretation and file uploads will likely remain the same.
Making your assistant aware of resource usage can be as simple as adding
the rule shown in listing 3.18 to the assistant’s instructions. The
instructions can be just a statement relaying the warning to the user and
making the assistant aware. You could even ask the assistant to limit its
usage of certain features.
Listing 3.18 Resource usage rule example
RULE:
When generating images, ensure the user is aware that creating multiple
images quickly could temporarily block their account.
Guiding your assistant to be more resource conscious in the end makes
your assistant more usable. It also helps prevent angry users who
unknowingly get blocked using your assistant. This may be important if
you plan on releasing your GPT, but before that, let’s investigate the
economics in the next section.
3.5.2 Understanding the economics of GPTs
Upon the release of GPT Assistants and the GPT Store, OpenAI announced
the potential for a future profit-sharing program for those who published
GPTs. While we’re still waiting to hear more about this program, many
have speculated what this may look like.
Some have suggested the store may return only 10% to 20% of profits to
the builders. This is far less than the percentage on other app platforms but
requires much less technical knowledge and fewer resources. The GPT
Store is flooded with essentially free assistants, provided you have a Plus
subscription, but that may change in the future. Regardless, there are also
several reasons why you may want to build public GPTs:
Personal portfolio —Perhaps you want to demonstrate your knowledge
of prompt engineering or your ability to build the next wave of AI
applications. Having a few GPTs in the GPT Store can help
demonstrate your knowledge and ability to create useful AI
applications.

## Page 121

Knowledge and experience —If you have in-depth knowledge of a
subject or topic, this can be a great way to package that as an assistant.
These types of assistants will vary in popularity based on your area of
expertise.
Cross-marketing and commercial tie-in —This is becoming more
common in the Store and provides companies the ability to lead
customers using an assistant. As companies integrate more AI, this will
certainly be more common.
Helpful assistant to your product/service —Not all companies or
organizations can sustain the cost of hosting chatbots. While consuming
assistants is currently limited to ChatGPT subscribers, they will likely
be more accessible in the future. This may mean having GPTs for
everything, perhaps like the internet’s early days where every company
rushed to build a web presence.
While the current form of the GPT Store is for ChatGPT subscribers, if the
current trend with OpenAI continues, we’ll likely see a fully public GPT
Store. Public GPTs have the potential to disrupt the way we search,
investigate products and services, and consume the internet. In the last
section of this chapter, we’ll examine how to publish a GPT and some
important considerations.
3.5.3 Releasing the GPT
Okay, you’re happy with your GPT and how it operates, and you see real
benefit from giving it to others. Publishing GPTs for public (subscribers)
consumption is easy, as shown in figure 3.14. After selecting the GPT Store
as the option and clicking Save, you’ll now have the option to set the
category and provide links back to you.

## Page 122

Figure 3.14 Selecting the options after clicking Save to publish to the GPT Store
That is easy, so here are a few more things you’ll want to consider before
publishing your GPT:
GPT description —Create a good description, and you may even want
to ask ChatGPT to help you build a description that increases the search
engine optimization (SEO) of your GPT. GPTs are now showing up in

## Page 123

Google searches, so good search engine optimization can help increase
exposure to your assistant. A good description will also help users
decide if they want to take the time to use your assistant.
The logo —A nice, clean logo that identifies what your assistant does
can undoubtedly help. Logo design for GPTs is effectively a free
service, but taking the time to iterate over a few images can help draw
users to your assistant.
The category —By default, the category will already be selected, but
make sure it fits your assistant. If you feel it doesn’t, than change the
category, and you may even want to select Other and define your own.
Links —Be sure to set reference links for your social media and perhaps
even a GitHub repository that you use to track problems for the GPT.
Adding links to your GPT demonstrates to users that they can reach out
to the builder if they encounter problems or have questions.
Further requirements may likely emerge as the GPT Store matures. The
business model remains to be established, and other learnings will likely
follow. Whether you decide to build GPTs for yourself or others, doing so
can help improve your understanding of how to build agents and assistants.
As we’ll see throughout the rest of this book, GPT assistants are a useful
foundation for your knowledge.

Summary
The OpenAI GPT Assistants platform enables building and deploying
AI agents through the ChatGPT UI, focusing on creating engaging and
functional assistants.
You can use GPT’s code interpretation capabilities to perform data
analysis on user-uploaded CSV files, enabling assistants to function as
data scientists.
Assistants can be extended with custom actions, allowing integration
with external services via API endpoints. This includes generating
FastAPI services and their corresponding OpenAPI specifications.
Assistants can be enriched with specialized knowledge through file
uploads, allowing them to act as authoritative sources on specific texts
or documents.
Commercializing your GPT involves publishing it to the GPT Store,
where you can share and market your assistant to a broader audience.
Building a functional assistant involves iterating through design
prompts, defining a clear persona, setting rules, and ensuring the
assistant’s output aligns with user expectations.
Creating custom actions requires understanding and implementing
OpenAPI specifications, deploying services locally using tools such as
ngrok, and connecting these services to your assistant.
Knowledge assistants can handle various tasks, from searching and

4 Exploring multi-agent systems
This chapter covers
Building multi-agent systems using AutoGen Studio
Building a simple multi-agent system
Creating agents that can work collaboratively over a group chat
Building an agent crew and multi-agent systems using CrewAI
Extending the number of agents and exploring processing patterns
with CrewAI
Now let’s take a journey from AutoGen to CrewAI, two well-established
multi-agent platforms. We’ll start with AutoGen, a Microsoft project that
supports multiple agents and provides a studio for working with them.
We’ll explore a project from Microsoft called AutoGen, which supports
multiple agents but also provides a studio to ease you into working with
agents. From there, we’ll get more hands-on coding of AutoGen agents to
solve tasks using conversations and group chat collaborations.
Then, we’ll transition to CrewAI, a self-proposed enterprise agentic system
that takes a different approach. CrewAI balances role-based and
autonomous agents that can be sequentially or hierarchically flexible task
management systems. We’ll explore how CrewAI can solve diverse and
complex problems.
Multi-agent systems incorporate many of the same tools single-agent
systems use but benefit from the ability to provide outside feedback and
evaluation to other agents. This ability to support and criticize agent
solutions internally gives multi-agent systems more power. We’ll explore
an introduction to multi-agent systems, beginning with AutoGen Studio in
the next section.

## Page 128

4.1 Introducing multi-agent systems with
AutoGen Studio
AutoGen Studio is a powerful tool that employs multiple agents behind the
scenes to solve tasks and problems a user directs. This tool has been used
to develop some of the more complex code in this book. For that reason
and others, it’s an excellent introduction to a practical multi-agent system.
Figure 4.1 shows a schematic diagram of the agent
connection/communication patterns AutoGen employs. AutoGen is a
conversational multi-agent platform because communication is done using
natural language. Natural language conversation seems to be the most
natural pattern for agents to communicate, but it’s not the only method, as
you’ll see later.
Figure 4.1 How AutoGen agents communicate through conversations (Source: AutoGen)

## Page 129

AutoGen supports various conversational patterns, from group and
hierarchical to the more common and simpler proxy communication. In
proxy communication, one agent acts as a proxy and directs
communication to relevant agents to complete tasks. A proxy is similar to a
waiter taking orders and delivering them to the kitchen, which cooks the
food. Then, the waiter serves the cooked food.
The basic pattern in AutoGen uses a and one or more assistant
UserProxy
agents. Figure 4.2 shows the user proxy taking direction from a human and
then directing an assistant agent enabled to write code to perform the tasks.
Each time the assistant completes a task, the proxy agent reviews,
evaluates, and provides feedback to the assistant. This iteration loop
continues until the proxy is satisfied with the results.
Figure 4.2 The user proxy agent and assistant agent communication (Source: AutoGen)
The benefit of the proxy is that it works to replace the required human
feedback and evaluation, and, in most cases, it does a good job. While it

## Page 130

doesn’t eliminate the need for human feedback and evaluation, it produces
much more complete results overall. And, while the iteration loop is time
consuming, it’s time you could be drinking a coffee or working on other
tasks.
AutoGen Studio is a tool developed by the AutoGen team that provides a
helpful introduction to conversable agents. In the next exercise, we’ll
install Studio and run some experiments to see how well the platform
performs. These tools are still in a rapid development cycle, so if you
encounter any problems, consult the documentation on the AutoGen
GitHub repository.
4.1.1 Installing and using AutoGen Studio
Open the folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), create a
chapter_04
local Python virtual environment, and install the file. If
requirements.txt
you need assistance with this, consult appendix B to install all of this
chapter’s exercise requirements.
Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl-`, Cmd-`) pointing to your virtual
environment, and run AutoGen Studio using the command shown in listing
4.1. You’ll first need to define an environment variable for your OpenAI
key. Because ports 8080 and 8081 are popular, and if you have other
services running, change the port to 8082 or something you choose.
Listing 4.1 Launching AutoGen Studio
# set environment variable on Bash (Git Bash)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=”<your API key>” #1
# sent environment variable with PowerShell
$env:VAR_NAME =”<your API key>" #1
autogenstudio ui --port 8081 #2
#1 Use the appropriate command for your terminal type.
#2 Change the port if you expect or experience a conflict on your machine.
Navigate your browser to the AutoGen Studio interface shown in figure 4.3
(as of this writing). While there may be differences, one thing is for sure:
the primary interface will still be chat. Enter a complex task that requires

## Page 131

coding. The example used here is
Create a plot showing the popularity
of the term GPT Agents in Google search.
Figure 4.3 Entering a task for the agents to work on in the AutoGen interface
The agent assistant generates code snippets to perform or complete various
subtasks as the agents work together through the task in the example. The
user proxy agent then attempts to execute those code snippets and assesses
the output. In many cases, proving the code runs and produces the required

## Page 132

output is sufficient for the user proxy agent to approve the task’s
completion.
If you encounter any problems with the assistant agent requests, ask the
proxy agent to try a different method or another problem. This highlights a
bigger problem with agentic systems using packages or libraries that have
expired and no longer work. For this reason, it’s generally better to get
agents to execute actions rather than build code to perform actions as tools.
Tip Executing AutoGen and AutoGen Studio using Docker is
recommended, especially when working with code that may affect the
operating system. Docker can isolate and virtualize the agents’
environment, thus isolating potentially harmful code. Using Docker can
help alleviate any secondary windows or websites that may block the
agent process from running.
Figure 4.4 shows the agent’s completion of the task. The proxy agent will
collect any generated code snippet, images, or other documents and append
them to the message. You can also review the agent conversation by
opening the Agent Messages expander. In many cases, if you ask the agent
to generate plots or applications, secondary windows will open showing
those results.

## Page 133

Figure 4.4 The output after the agents complete the task
Amazingly, the agents will perform most tasks nicely and complete them
well. Depending on the complexity of the task, you may need to further
iterate with the proxy. Sometimes, an agent may only go so far to complete
a task because it lacks the required skills. In the next section, we’ll look at
how to add skills to agents.
4.1.2 Adding skills in AutoGen Studio
Skills and tools, or actions, as we refer to them in this book, are the
primary means by which agents can extend themselves. Actions give
agents the ability to execute code, call APIs, or even further evaluate and

## Page 134

inspect generated output. AutoGen Studio currently begins with just a basic
set of tools to fetch web content or generate images.
Note Many agentic systems employ the practice of allowing agents
to code to solve goals. However, we discovered that code can be easily
broken, needs to be maintained, and can change quickly. Therefore, as
we’ll discuss in later chapters, it’s better to provide agents with
skills/actions/tools to solve problems.
In the following exercise scenario, we’ll add a skill/action to inspect an
image using the OpenAI vision model. This will allow the proxy agent to
provide feedback if we ask the assistant to generate an image with
particular content.
With AutoGen Studio running, go to the Build tab and click Skills, as
shown in figure 4.5. Then, click the New Skill button to open a code panel
where you can copy–paste code to. From this tab, you can also configure
models, agents, and agent workflows.

## Page 135

## Page 136

Figure 4.5 Steps to creating a new skill on the Build tab
Enter the code shown in listing 4.2 and also provided in the book’s source
code as . Copy and paste this code into the editor
describe_image.py
window, and then click the Save button at the bottom.

## Page 137

Listing 4.2 describe_image.py
import base64
import requests
import os
def describe_image(image_path='animals.png') -> str:
"""

# Function to encode the image
def encode_image(image_path): #1
with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
# Getting the base64 string
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)

}

["content"] #3
#1 Function to load and encode the image as a Base64 string
#2 Including the image string along with the JSON payload
#3 Unpacking the response and returning the content of the reply

## Page 138

The function uses the OpenAI GPT-4 vision model to
describe_image
describe what is in the image. This skill can be paired with the existing
generate_image skill as a quality assessment. The agents can confirm that
the generated image matches the user’s requirements.
After the skill is added, it must be added to the specific agent workflow
and agent for use. Figure 4.6 demonstrates adding the new skill to the
primary assistant agent in the general or default agent workflow.

## Page 139

Figure 4.6 Configuring the primary_assistant agent with the new skill
Now that the skill is added to the primary assistant, we can task the agent
with creating a specific image and validating it using the new

## Page 140

describe_image skill. Because image generators notoriously struggle with
correct text, we’ll create an exercise task to do just that.
Enter the text shown in listing 4.3 to prompt the agents to create a book
image cover for this book. We’ll explicitly say that the text needs to be
correct and insist that the agent uses the new function to
describe_image
verify the image.
Listing 4.3 Prompting for a book cover
Please create a cover for the book GPT Agents In Action, use the
describe_image skill to make sure the title of the book is spelled
correctly on the cover
After the prompt is entered, wait for a while, and you may get to see some
dialogue exchanged about the image generation and verification process. In
the end, though, if everything works correctly, the agents will return with
the results shown in figure 4.7.

## Page 141

Figure 4.7 The generated file outputs from the agent work on the image generation task
Remarkably, the agent coordination completed the task in just a couple of
iterations. Along with the images, you can also see the various helper code
snippets generated to assist with task completion. AutoGen Studio is
impressive in its ability to integrate skills that the agents can further adapt
to complete some goal. The following section will show how these
powerful agents are implemented in code.

## Page 142

4.2 Exploring AutoGen
While AutoGen Studio is a fantastic tool for understanding multi-agent
systems, we must look into the code. Fortunately, coding multiple agent
examples with AutoGen is simple and easy to run. We’ll cover the basic
AutoGen setup in the next section.
4.2.1 Installing and consuming AutoGen
This next exercise will look at coding a basic multi-agent system that uses
a user proxy and conversable agent. Before we do that, though, we want to
make sure AutoGen is installed and configured correctly.
Open a terminal in VS Code, and run the entire chapter 4 install directions
per appendix B, or run the command in listing 4.4. If you’ve installed
pip
the file, you’ll also be ready to run AutoGen.
requirements.txt
Listing 4.4 Installing AutoGen
pip install pyautogen
Next, copy the to
chapter_04/OAI_CONFIG_LIST.example
, removing from the file name. Then, open the
OAI_CONFIG_LIST .example
new file in VS Code, and enter your OpenAI or Azure configuration in the
file in listing 4.5. Fill in your API key, model, and other
OAI_CONFIG_LIST
details per your API service requirements. AutoGen will work with any
model that adheres to the OpenAI client. That means you can use local
LLMs via LM Studio or other services such as Groq, Hugging Face, and
more.

## Page 143

Listing 4.5 OAI_CONFIG_LIST
[

"model": "gpt-4", #1
"api_key": "<your OpenAI API key here>", #2

}
]

#2 Use the service key you would typically use.
#3 Select the model; GPT-4 is recommended.
#4 Use the service key you would typically use.
#5 Changing the base URL allows you to point to other services, not just Azure OpenAI.
Now, we can look at the code for a basic multi-agent chat using the out-of-
the-box and agents. Open
UserProxy ConversableAgent
in VS Code, shown in the following listing, and review
autogen_start.py
the parts before running the file.

## Page 144

Listing 4.6 autogen_start.py
from autogen import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json
config_list = config_list_from_json(
env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST") #1
assistant = ConversableAgent(
"agent",
llm_config={"config_list": config_list}) #2
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent( #3
"user",
code_execution_config={
"work_dir": "working",
"use_docker": False,
},
human_input_mode="ALWAYS",
is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "")
.rstrip()
.endswith("TERMINATE"), #4
)
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="write a solution
↪ for fizz buzz in one line?") #5
#1 Loads your LLM configuration from the JSON file OAI_CONFIG_LIST
#2 This agent talks directly to the LLM.
#3 This agent proxies conversations from the user to the assistant.
#4 Setting the termination message allows the agent to iterate.
#5 A chat is initiated with the assistant through the user_proxy to complete a task.
Run the code by running the file in VS Code in the debugger (F5). The
code in listing 4.6 uses a simple task to demonstrate code writing. Listing
4.7 shows a few examples to choose from. These coding tasks are also
some of the author’s regular baselines to assess an LLMs’ strength in
coding.
Listing 4.7 Simple coding task examples
write a Python function to check if a number is prime
code a classic sname game using Pygame #1
code a classic asteroids game in Python using Pygame #1
#1 To enjoy iterating over these tasks, use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows,
or use Docker.
After the code starts in a few seconds, the assistant will respond to the
proxy with a solution. At this time, the proxy will prompt you for feedback.
Press Enter, essentially giving no feedback, and this will prompt the proxy
to run the code to verify it operates as expected.

## Page 145

Impressively, the proxy agent will even take cues to install required
packages such as Pygame. Then it will run the code, and you’ll see the
output in the terminal or as a new window or browser. You can play the
game or use the interface if the code shelled a new window/browser.
Note that the spawned window/browser won’t close on Windows and will
require exiting the entire program. To avoid this problem, run the code
through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Docker. AutoGen
explicitly recommends using Docker for code execution agents, and if
you’re comfortable with containers, this is a good option.
Either way, after the proxy generates and runs the code, the
working_dir
folder set earlier in listing 4.6 should now have a Python file with the code.
This will allow you to run the code at your leisure, make changes, or even
ask for improvements, as we’ll see. In the next section, we’ll look at how
to improve the capabilities of the coding agents.
4.2.2 Enhancing code output with agent critics
One powerful benefit of multi-agent systems is the multiple roles/personas
you can automatically assign when completing tasks. Generating or
helping to write code can be an excellent advantage to any developer, but
what if that code was also reviewed and tested? In the next exercise, we’ll
add another agent critic to our agent system to help with coding tasks.
Open , as shown in the following listing.
autogen_coding_critic.py

}
],

## Page 147

trigger=engineer, #4
)
task = """Write a snake game using Pygame."""
res = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
recipient=engineer,
message=task,
max_turns=2,
summary_method="last_msg" #5
)
#1 This time, the assistant is given a system/persona message.
#2 A second assistant critic agent is created with a background.
#3 A custom function helps extract the code for review by the critic.
#4 A nested chat is created between the critic and the engineer.
#5 The proxy agent initiates a chat with a max delay and explicit summary method.
Run the file in VS Code in debug mode, and
autogen_coding_critic.py
watch the dialog between the agents. This time, after the code returns, the
critic will also be triggered to respond. Then, the critic will add comments
and suggestions to improve the code.
Nested chats work well for supporting and controlling agent interactions,
but we’ll see a better approach in the following section. Before that though,
we’ll review the importance of the AutoGen cache in the next section.
4.2.3 Understanding the AutoGen cache
AutoGen can consume many tokens over chat iterations as a conversable
multi-agent platform. If you ask AutoGen to work through complex or
novel problems, you may even encounter token limits on your LLM;
because of this, AutoGen supports several methods to reduce token usage.
AutoGen uses caching to store progress and reduce token usage. Caching is
enabled by default, and you may have already encountered it. If you check
your current working folder, you’ll notice a folder, as shown in
.cache
figure 4.8. Caching allows your agents to continue conversations if they
get interrupted.

## Page 148

Figure 4.8 AutoGen cache and working folders
In code, you can control the cache folder for your agent’s run, as shown in
listing 4.9. By wrapping the call with the statement,
initiate_chat with
you can control the location and seed for the cache. This will allow you to
save and return to long-running AutoGen tasks in the future by just setting
the for the previous cache.
cache_seed
Listing 4.9 Setting the cache folder
with Cache.disk(cache_seed=42) as cache: #1
res = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
recipient=engineer,
message=task,
max_turns=2,
summary_method="last_msg",
cache=cache, #2
)
#1 Setting the seed_cache denotes the individual location.
#2 Sets the cache as a parameter
This caching ability allows you to continue operations from the previous
cache location and captures previous runs. It can also be a great way to
demonstrate and inspect how an agent conversation generated the results.

## Page 149

In the next section, we’ll look at another conversational pattern in which
AutoGen supports group chat.
4.3 Group chat with agents and AutoGen
One problem with chat delegation and nested chats or conversations is the
conveyance of information. If you’ve ever played the telephone game,
you’ve witnessed this firsthand and experienced how quickly information
can change over iterations. With agents, this is certainly no different, and
chatting through nested or sequential conversations can alter the task or
even the desired result.
THE TELEPHONE GAME
The telephone game is a fun but educational game that demonstrates
information and coherence loss. Children form a line, and the first child
receives a message only they can hear. Then, in turn, the children
verbally pass the message on to the next child, and so on. At the end, the
last child announces the message to the whole group, which often isn’t
even close to the same message.
To counter this, AutoGen provides a group chat, a mechanism by which
agents participate in a shared conversation. This allows agents to review
all past conversations and better collaborate on long-running and
complex tasks.
Figure 4.9 shows the difference between nested and collaborative group
chats. We used the nested chat feature in the previous section to build a
nested agent chat. In this section, we use the group chat to provide a more
collaborative experience.

## Page 150

Figure 4.9 The difference between nested and group chat for conversable agents
Open with relevant parts, as shown in listing
autogen_coding_group.py
4.10. The code is similar to the previous exercise but now introduces
and . The agents and messages are held with
GroupChat GroupChatManager
the group chat, similar to a messaging channel in applications such as
Slack or Discord. The chat manager coordinates the message responses to
reduce conversation overlap.

## Page 151

Listing 4.10 autoget_coding_group.py (relevant sections)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
"user",
code_execution_config={
"work_dir": "working",
"use_docker": False,
"last_n_messages": 3,
},
human_input_mode="NEVER", #1
)
llm_config = {"config_list": config_list}
engineer = AssistantAgent(… #2
critic = AssistantAgent(… #2
groupchat = GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy,
engineer,
critic],
messages=[],
max_round=20) #3
manager = GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat,
llm_config=llm_config) #4
task = """Write a snake game using Pygame."""
with Cache.disk(cache_seed=43) as cache:
res = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
recipient=manager,
message=task,
cache=cache,
)
#1 Human input is now set to never, so no human feedback.
#2 Code omitted, but consult changes to the persona in the file
#3 This object holds the connection to all the agents and stores the messages.
#4 The manager coordinates the conversation as a moderator would.
Run this exercise, and you’ll see how the agents collaborate. The engineer
will now take feedback from the critic and undertake operations to address
the critic’s suggestions. This also allows the proxy to engage in all of the
conversation.
Group conversations are an excellent way to strengthen your agents’
abilities as they collaborate on tasks. However, they are also substantially
more verbose and token expensive. Of course, as LLMs mature, so do the
size of their context token windows and the price of token processing. As
token windows increase, concerns over token consumption may eventually
go away.

## Page 152

AutoGen is a powerful multi-agent platform that can be experienced using
a web interface or code. Whatever your preference, this agent collaboration
tool is an excellent platform for building code or other complex tasks. Of
course, it isn’t the only platform, as you’ll see in the next section, where
we explore a newcomer called CrewAI.
4.4 Building an agent crew with CrewAI
CrewAI is relatively new to the realm of multi-agent systems. Where
AutoGen was initially developed from research and then extended, CrewAI
is built with enterprise systems in mind. As such, the platform is more
robust, making it less extensible in some areas.
With CrewAI, you build a crew of agents to focus on specific areas of a
task goal. Unlike AutoGen, CrewAI doesn’t require the use of the user
proxy agent but instead assumes the agents only work among themselves.
Figure 4.10 shows the main elements of the CrewAI platform, how they
connect together, and their primary function. It shows a sequential-
processing agent system with generic researcher and writer agents. Agents
are assigned tasks that may also include tools or memory to assist them.

## Page 153

[No extractable text]

## Page 154

Figure 4.10 The composition of a CrewAI system
CrewAI supports two primary forms of processing: sequential and
hierarchical. Figure 4.10 shows the sequential process by iterating across
the given agents and their associated tasks. In the next section, we dig into
some code to set up a crew and employ it to complete a goal and create a
good joke.
4.4.1 Creating a jokester crew of CrewAI agents
CrewAI requires more setup than AutoGen, but this also allows for more
control and additional guides, which provide more specific context to
guide the agents in completing the given task. This isn’t without problems,
but it does offer more control than AutoGen out of the box.
Open in VS Code and look at the top section, as
crewai_introduction.py
shown in listing 4.11. Many settings are required to configure an agent,
including the role, goal, verboseness, memory, backstory, delegation, and
even tools (not shown). In this example, we’re using two agents: a senior
joke researcher and a joke writer.

## Page 155

Listing 4.11 crewai_introduction.py (agent section)
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
joke_researcher = Agent( #1
role="Senior Joke Researcher",
goal="Research what makes things funny about the following {topic}",
verbose=True, #2
memory=True, #3
backstory=( #4
"Driven by slapstick humor, you are a seasoned joke researcher"
"who knows what makes people laugh. You have a knack for finding"
"the funny in everyday situations and can turn a dull moment into"
"a laugh riot."
),
allow_delegation=True, #5
)
joke_writer = Agent( #6
role="Joke Writer",
goal="Write a humourous and funny joke on the following {topic}",
verbose=True, #7
memory=True, #8
backstory=( #9
"You are a joke writer with a flair for humor. You can turn a"
"simple idea into a laugh riot. You have a way with words and"
"can make people laugh with just a few lines."
),
allow_delegation=False, #5
)
#1 Creates the agents and provides them a goal
#2 verbose allows the agent to emit output to the terminal.
#3 Supports the use of memory for the agents
#4 The backstory is the agent’s background—its persona.
#5 The agents can either be delegated to or are allowed to delegate; True means they can
delegate.
#6 Creates the agents and provides them a goal
#7 verbose allows the agent to emit output to the terminal.
#8 Supports the use of memory for the agents
#9 The backstory is the agent’s background—its persona.
Moving down the code, we next see the tasks, as shown in listing 4.12.
Tasks denote an agent’s process to complete the primary system goal. They
also link an agent to work on a specific task, define the output from that
task, and may include how it’s executed.

"relevant to the current social trends."
),

Now, we can see how everything comes together as the at the bottom
Crew
of the file, as shown in listing 4.13. Again, many options can be set when
building the , including the agents, tasks, process type, memory,
Crew
cache, maximum requests per minute ( ), and whether the crew
max_rpm
shares.

## Page 157

Listing 4.13 crewai_introduction.py (crew section)
crew = Crew(
agents=[joke_researcher, joke_writer], #1
tasks=[research_task, write_task], #2
process=Process.sequential, #3
memory=True, #4
cache=True, #5
max_rpm=100, #6
share_crew=True, #7
)
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI engineer jokes"})
print(result)

#2 The tasks the agents can work on
#3 Defining how the agents will interact
#4 Whether the system should use memory; needs to be set if agents/tasks have it on
#5 Whether the system should use a cache, similar to AutoGen
#6 Maximum requests per minute the system should limit itself to
#7 Whether the crew should share information, similar to group chat
When you’re done reviewing, run the file in VS Code (F5), and watch the
terminal for conversations and messages from the crew. As you can
probably tell by now, the goal of this agent system is to craft jokes related
to AI engineering. Here are some of the funnier jokes generated over a few
runs of the agent system:
Why was the computer cold? It left Windows open.
Why don’t AI engineers play hide and seek with their algorithms?
Because no matter where they hide, the algorithms always find them in
the “overfitting” room!
What is an AI engineer’s favorite song? “I just called to say I love yo…
. and to collect more data for my voice recognition software.”
Why was the AI engineer broke? Because he spent all his money on
cookies, but his browser kept eating them.
Before you run more iterations of the joke crew, you should read the next
section. This section shows how to add observability to the multi-agent
system.

## Page 158

4.4.2 Observing agents working with AgentOps
Observing a complex assemblage such as a multi-agent system is critical to
understanding the myriad of problems that can happen. Observability
through application tracing is a key element of any complex system,
especially one engaged in enterprise use.
CrewAI supports connecting to a specialized agent operations platform
appropriately called AgentOps. This observability platform is generic and
designed to support observability with any agent platform specific to LLM
usage. Currently, no pricing or commercialization details are available.
Connecting to AgentOps is as simple as installing the package, getting an
API key, and adding a line of code to your crew setup. This next exercise
will go through the steps to connect and run AgentOps.
Listing 4.14 shows installing the package using . You can
agentops pip
install the package alone or as an additional component of the
crewai
package. Remember that AgentOps can also be connected to other agent
platforms for observability.
Listing 4.14 Installing AgentOps
pip install agentops
or as an option with CrewAI
pip install crewai[agentops]
Before using AgentOps, you need to sign up for an API key. Following are
the general steps to sign up for a key at the time of writing:
1. Visit https://app.agentops.ai in your browser.
2. Sign up for an account.
3. Create a project, or use the default.
4. Go to Settings > Projects and API Keys.
5. Copy and/or generate a new API key; this will copy the key to your
browser.
6. Paste the key to your file in your project.
.env

## Page 159

After the API key is copied, it should resemble the example shown in the
following listing.
Listing 4.15 env.: Adding an AgentOps key
AGENTOPS_API_KEY="your API key"
Now, we need to add a few lines of code to the CrewAI script. Listing 4.16
shows the additions as they are added to the file.
crewai_agentops.py
When creating your own scripts, all you need to do is add the
agentops
package and initialize it when using CrewAI.
Listing 4.16 crewai_agentops.py (AgentOps additions)
import agentops #1
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
agentops.init() #2
#1 The addition of the required package
#2 Make sure to initialize the package after the environment variables are loaded.
Run the file in VS Code (F5), and watch the agents
crewai_agentops.py
work as before. However, you can now go to the AgentOps dashboard and
view the agent interactions at various levels.
Figure 4.11 shows the dashboard for running the joke crew to create the
best joke. Several statistics include total duration, the run environment,
prompt and completion tokens, LLM call timings, and estimated cost.
Seeing the cost can be both sobering and indicative of how verbose agent
conversations can become.

## Page 160

Figure 4.11 The AgentOps dashboard for running the joke crew
The AgentOps platform is an excellent addition to any agent platform.
While it’s built into CrewAI, it’s helpful that the observability could be
added to AutoGen or other frameworks. Another attractive thing about
AgentOps is that it’s dedicated to observing agent interactions and not
transforming from a machine learning operations platform. In the future,
we’ll likely see the spawn of more agent observability patterns.

## Page 161

One benefit that can’t be overstated is the cost observation that an
observability platform can provide. Did you notice in figure 4.11 that
creating a single joke costs a little over 50 cents? Agents can be very
powerful, but they can also become very costly, and it’s essential to
observe what those costs are in terms of practicality and
commercialization.
In the last section of this chapter, we’ll return to CrewAI and revisit
building agents that can code games. This will provide an excellent
comparison between the capabilities of AutoGen and CrewAI.
4.5 Revisiting coding agents with CrewAI
A great way to compare capabilities between multi-agent platforms is to
implement similar tasks in a bot. In this next set of exercises, we’ll employ
CrewAI as a game programming team. Of course, this could be adapted to
other coding tasks as well.
Open in VS Code, and we’ll first review the
crewai_coding_crew.py
agent section in listing 4.17. Here, we’re creating a senior engineer, a QA
engineer, and a chief QA engineer with a role, goal, and backstory.

## Page 162

Listing 4.17 crewai_coding_crew.py (agent section)
print("## Welcome to the Game Crew") #1
print("-------------------------------")
game = input("What is the game you would like to build?
↪ What will be the mechanics?\n")
senior_engineer_agent = Agent(
role="Senior Software Engineer",
goal="Create software as needed",
backstory=dedent(
"""
You are a Senior Software Engineer at a leading tech think tank.
Your expertise in programming in python. and do your best to
produce perfect code
"""
),
allow_delegation=False,
verbose=True,
)
qa_engineer_agent = Agent(
role="Software Quality Control Engineer",
goal="create prefect code, by analizing the code
↪ that is given for errors",
backstory=dedent(
"""
You are a software engineer that specializes in checking code

"""
),
allow_delegation=False,
verbose=True,
)
chief_qa_engineer_agent = Agent(
role="Chief Software Quality Control Engineer",
goal="Ensure that the code does the job that it is supposed to do",
backstory=dedent(
"""

tech think tank. You are responsible for ensuring that the code

"""
),
allow_delegation=True, #2
verbose=True,
)
#1 Allows the user to input the instructions for their game
#2 Only the chief QA engineer can delegate tasks.

## Page 163

Scrolling down in the file will display the agent tasks, as shown in listing
4.18. The task descriptions and expected output should be easy to follow.
Again, each agent has a specific task to provide better context when
working to complete the task.
Listing 4.18 crewai_coding_crew.py (task section)
code_task = Task(
description=f"""
You will create a game using python, these are the instructions:
Instructions
------------
{game} #1
You will write the code for the game using python.""",
expected_output="Your Final answer must be the
↪ full python code, only the python code and nothing else.",
agent=senior_engineer_agent,
)
qa_task = Task(
description=f"""You are helping create a game
↪ using python, these are the instructions:
Instructions
------------
{game} #1

syntax errors, missing imports, variable declarations,

and security vulnerabilities.""",
expected_output="Output a list of issues you found in the code.",
agent=qa_engineer_agent,
)
evaluate_task = Task(
description=f"""You are helping create a game
↪ using python, these are the instructions:
Instructions
------------
{game} #1
You will look over the code to insure that it is complete and
does the job that it is supposed to do. """,
expected_output="Your Final answer must be the
↪ corrected a full python code, only the python code and nothing else.",
agent=chief_qa_engineer_agent,
)
#1 The game instructions are substituted into the prompt using Python formatting.
Finally, we can see how this comes together by going to the bottom of the
file, as shown in listing 4.19. This crew configuration is much like what
we’ve seen before. Each agent and task are added, as well as the verbose
and process attributes. For this example, we’ll continue to use sequential
methods.

## Page 164

Listing 4.19 crewai_coding_crew.py (crew section)
crew = Crew(
agents=[senior_engineer_agent,
qa_engineer_agent,
chief_qa_engineer_agent],
tasks=[code_task, qa_task, evaluate_task],
verbose=2,
process=Process.sequential, #1
)
# Get your crew to work!
result = crew.kickoff() #2
print("######################")
print(result)
#1 Process is sequential.
#2 No additional context is provided in the kickoff.
When you run the VS Code (F5) file, you’ll be prompted to enter the
instructions for writing a game. Enter some instructions, perhaps the snake
game or another game you choose. Then, let the agents work, and observe
what they produce.
With the addition of the chief QA engineer, the results will generally look
better than what was produced with AutoGen, at least out of the box. If you
review the code, you’ll see that it generally follows good patterns and, in
some cases, may even include tests and unit tests.
Before we finish the chapter, we’ll make one last change to the crew’s
processing pattern. Previously, we employed sequential processing, as
shown in figure 4.10. Figure 4.12 shows what hierarchical processing
looks like in CrewAI.

## Page 165

[No extractable text]

## Page 166

Figure 4.12 Hierarchical processing of agents coordinated through a crew manager
Adding this manager is a relatively simple process. Listing 4.20 shows the
additional code changes to a new file that uses the coding crew in a
hierarchical method. Aside from importing a class for connecting to
OpenAI from LangChain, the other addition is adding this class as the crew
manger, .
manager_llm
Listing 4.20 crewai_hierarchy.py (crew manager sections)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI #1
crew = Crew(
agents=[senior_engineer_agent,
qa_engineer_agent,
chief_qa_engineer_agent],
tasks=[code_task, qa_task, evaluate_task],
verbose=2,
process=Process.hierarchical, #2
manager_llm=ChatOpenAI( #3
temperature=0, model="gpt-4" #3
), #4
) #4
#1 Imports the LLM connector from LangChain
#2 You must set a crew manager when selecting hierarchical processing.
#3 Sets the crew manager to be the LLM connector
#4 You must set a crew manager when selecting hierarchical processing.
Run this file in VS Code (F5). When prompted, enter a game you want to
create. Try using the same game you tried with AutoGen; the snake game is
also a good baseline example. Observe the agents work through the code
and review it repeatedly for problems.
After you run the file, you can also jump on AgentOps to review the cost of
this run. Chances are, it will cost over double what it would have without
the agent manager. The output will also likely not be significantly better.
This is the trap of building agent systems without understanding how
quickly things can spiral.
An example of this spiral that often happens when agents continually
iterate over the same actions is frequently repeating tasks. You can view
this problem in AgentOps, as shown in figure 4.13, by viewing the Repeat
Thoughts plot.

## Page 167

Figure 4.13 The repetition of thoughts as they occurred within an agent run
The Repeat Thoughts plot from AgentOps is an excellent way to measure
the repetition your agent system encounters. Overly repetitive thought
patterns typically mean the agent isn’t being decisive enough and instead
keeps trying to generate a different answer. If you encounter this problem,
you want to change the agents’ processing patterns, tasks, and goals. You
may even want to alter the system’s type and number of agents.
Multi-agent systems are an excellent way to break up work in terms of
work patterns of jobs and tasks. Generally, the job role is allocated to an
agent role/persona, and the tasks it needs to complete may be implicit, as in
AutoGen, or more explicit, as in CrewAI.
In this chapter, we covered many useful tools and platforms that you can
use right away to improve your work, life, and more. That completes our
journey through multi-agent platforms, but it doesn’t conclude our
exploration and use of multiple agents, as we’ll discover in later chapters.

of the agents. Identify any potential inefficiencies or errors in agent
interactions.

## Page 170

Summary
AutoGen, developed by Microsoft, is a conversational multi-agent
platform that employs a variety of agent types, such as user proxies and
assistant agents, to facilitate task execution through natural language
interactions.
AutoGen Studio acts as a development environment that allows users to
create, test, and manage multi-agent systems, enhancing the usability of
AutoGen.
AutoGen supports multiple communication patterns, including group
chats and hierarchical and proxy communications. Proxy
communication involves a primary agent (proxy) that interfaces
between the user and other agents to streamline task completion.
CrewAI offers a structured approach to building multi-agent systems
with a focus on enterprise applications. It emphasizes role-based and
autonomous agent functionalities, allowing for flexible, sequential, or
hierarchical task management.
Practical exercises in the chapter illustrate how to set up and use
AutoGen Studio, including installing necessary components and
running basic multi-agent systems.
Agents in AutoGen can be equipped with specific skills to perform
tasks such as code generation, image analysis, and data retrieval,
thereby broadening their application scope.
CrewAI is distinguished by its ability to structure agent interactions
more rigidly than AutoGen, which can be advantageous in settings that
require precise and controlled agent behavior.
CrewAI supports integrating memory and tools for agents to consume
through task completion.
CrewAI supports integration with observability tools such as AgentOps,
which provides insights into agent performance, interaction efficiency,
and cost management.
AgentOps is an agent observability platform that can help you easily
monitor extensive agent interactions.

5 Empowering agents with actions
This chapter covers
How an agent acts outside of itself using actions
Defining and using OpenAI functions
The Semantic Kernel and how to use semantic functions
Synergizing semantic and native functions
Instantiating a GPT interface with Semantic Kernel
In this chapter, we explore actions through the use of functions and how
agents can use them as well. We’ll start by looking at OpenAI function
calling and then quickly move on to another project from Microsoft called
Semantic Kernel (SK), which we’ll use to build and manage skills and
functions for agents or as agents.
We’ll finish the chapter using SK to host our first agent system. This will
be a complete chapter with plenty of annotated code examples.
5.1 Defining agent actions
ChatGPT plugins were first introduced to provide a session with abilities,
skills, or tools. With a plugin, you can search the web or create
spreadsheets or graphs. Plugins provide ChatGPT with the means to extend
the platform.
Figure 5.1 shows how a ChatGPT plugin works. In this example, a new
movie recommender plugin has been installed in ChatGPT. When a user
asks ChatGPT to recommend a new movie, the large language model
(LLM) recognizes that it has a plugin to manage that action. It then breaks
down the user request into actionable parameters, which it passes to the
new movie recommender.

## Page 172

Figure 5.1 How a ChatGPT plugin operates and how plugins and other external tools (e.g., APIs)
align with the Use External Tools prompt engineering strategy

## Page 173

The recommender then scrapes a website showcasing new movies and
appends that information to a new prompt request to an LLM. With this
information, the LLM responds to the recommender, which passes this
back to ChatGPT. ChatGPT then responds to the user with the
recommended request.
We can think of plugins as proxies for actions. A plugin generally
encapsulates one or more abilities, such as calling an API or scraping a
website. Actions, therefore, are extensions of plugins—they give a plugin
its abilities.
AI agents can be considered plugins and consumers of plugins, tools,
skills, and other agents. Adding skills, functions, and tools to an
agent/plugin allows it to execute well-defined actions—figure 5.2
highlights where agent actions occur and their interaction with LLMs and
other systems.

## Page 174

Figure 5.2 How an agent uses actions to perform external tasks
An agent action is an ability that allows it to use a function, skill, or tool.
What gets confusing is that different frameworks use different terminology.
We’ll define an action as anything an agent can do to establish some basic
definitions.
ChatGPT plugins and functions represent an actionable ability that
ChatGPT or an agent system can use to perform additional actions. Now
let’s examine the basis for OpenAI plugins and the function definition.

## Page 175

5.2 Executing OpenAI functions
OpenAI, with the enablement of plugins, introduced a structure
specification for defining the interface between functions/plugins an LLM
could action. This specification is becoming a standard that LLM systems
can follow to provide actionable systems.
These same function definitions are now also being used to define plugins
for ChatGPT and other systems. Next, we’ll explore how to use functions
directly with an LLM call.
5.2.1 Adding functions to LLM API calls
Figure 5.3 demonstrates how an LLM recognizes and uses the function
definition to cast its response as the function call.

## Page 176

Figure 5.3 How a single LLM request, including tools, gets interpreted by an LLM
Listing 5.1 shows the details of an LLM API call using tools and a function
definition. Adding a function definition allows the LLM to reply regarding
the function’s input parameters. This means the LLM will identify the
correct function and parse the relevant parameters for the user’s request.

## Page 177

Listing 5.1 first_function.py (API call)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
messages=[{"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
{"role": "user", "content": user_message}],
temperature=0.7,
tools=[ #1
{
"type": "function", #2
"function": {
"name": "recommend",
"description": "Provide a … topic.", #3
"parameters": {
"type": "object", #4
"properties": {
"topic": {
"type": "string",
"description":
"The topic,… for.", #5
},
"rating": {
"type": "string",
"description":
"The rating … given.", #5
"enum": ["good",
"bad",
"terrible"] #6
},
},
"required": ["topic"],
},
},
}
]
)
#1 New parameter called tools
#2 Sets the type of tool to function
#3 Provides an excellent description of what the function does
#4 Defines the type of parameters for input; an object represents a JSON document.
#5 Excellent descriptions for each input parameter
#6 You can even describe in terms of enumerations.
To see how this works, open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to the book’s
source code folder: . It’s a good practice to
chapter_4/first_function.py
open the relevant chapter folder in VS Code to create a new Python
environment and install the file. If you need assistance
requirements.txt
with this, consult appendix B.
Before starting, correctly set up an file in the folder with
.env chapter_4
your API credentials. Function calling is an extra capability provided by

## Page 178

the LLM commercial service. At the time of writing, this feature wasn’t an
option for open source LLM deployments.
Next, we’ll look at the bottom of the code in as
first_function.py,
shown in listing 5.2. Here are just two examples of calls made to an LLM
using the request previously specified in listing 5.1. Here, each request
shows the generated output from running the example.
Listing 5.2 first_function.py (exercising the API)
user = "Can you please recommend me a time travel movie?"
response = ask_chatgpt(user) #1
print(response)
###Output
Function(arguments='{"topic":"time travel movie"}',
name='recommend') #2
user = "Can you please recommend me a good time travel movie?"
response = ask_chatgpt(user) #3
print(response)
###Output
Function(arguments='{"topic":"time travel movie",
"rating":"good"}',
name='recommend') #4
#1 Previously defined function
#2 Returned in the name of the function to call and the extracted input parameters
#3 Previously defined function
#4 Returned in the name of the function to call and the extracted input parameters
Run the Python script in VS Code using the debugger
first_function.py
(F5) or the terminal to see the same results. Here, the LLM parses the input
request to match any registered tools. In this case, the tool is the single
function definition, that is, the recommended function. The LLM extracts
the input parameters from this function and parses those from the request.
Then, it replies with the named function and designated input parameters.
NOTE The actual function isn’t being called. The LLM only returns
the suggested function and the relevant input parameters. The name and
parameters must be extracted and passed into a function matching the
signature to act on the function. We’ll look at an example of this in the
next section.

## Page 179

5.2.2 Actioning function calls
Now that we understand that an LLM doesn’t execute the function or
plugin directly, we can look at an example that executes the tools. Keeping
with the recommender theme, we’ll look at another example that adds a
Python function for simple recommendations.
Figure 5.4 shows how this simple example will work. We’ll submit a single
request that includes a tool function definition, asking for three
recommendations. The LLM, in turn, will reply with the three function
calls with input parameters (time travel, recipe, and gift). The results from
executing the functions are then passed back to the LLM, which converts
them back to natural language and returns a reply.

## Page 180

Figure 5.4 A sample request returns three tool function calls and then submits the results back to
the LLM to return a natural language response.
Now that we understand the example, open in VS
parallel_functions.py
Code. Listing 5.3 shows the Python function that you want to call to give
recommendations.

## Page 181

Listing 5.3 parallel_functions.py (recommend function)
def recommend(topic, rating="good"):
if "time travel" in topic.lower(): #1
return json.dumps({"topic": "time travel",
"recommendation": "Back to the Future",
"rating": rating})
elif "recipe" in topic.lower(): #1
return json.dumps({"topic": "recipe",
"recommendation": "The best thing … ate.",
"rating": rating})
elif "gift" in topic.lower(): #1
return json.dumps({"topic": "gift",
"recommendation": "A glorious new...",
"rating": rating})
else: #2
return json.dumps({"topic": topic,
"recommendation": "unknown"}) #3
#1 Checks to see if the string is contained within the topic input
#2 If no topic is detected, returns the default
#3 Returns a JSON object
Next, we’ll look at the function called , where all the
run_conversation
work starts with the request construction.

## Page 182

Listing 5.4 parallel_functions.py (run_conversation, request)
user = """Can you please make recommendations for the following:
1. Time travel movies
2. Recipes
3. Gifts""" #1
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user}] #2
tools = [ #3
{
"type": "function",
"function": {
"name": "recommend",
"description":
"Provide a recommendation for any topic.",
"parameters": {
"type": "object",
"properties": {
"topic": {
"type": "string",
"description":
"The topic, … recommendation for.",
},
"rating": {
"type": "string",
"description": "The rating … was given.",
"enum": ["good", "bad", "terrible"]
},
},
"required": ["topic"],
},
},
}
]
#1 The user message asks for three recommendations.
#2 Note that there is no system message.
#3 Adds the function definition to the tools part of the request
Listing 5.5 shows the request being made, which we’ve covered before, but
there are a few things to note. This call uses a lower model such as GPT-
3.5 because delegating functions is a more straightforward task and can be
done using older, cheaper, less sophisticated language models.
Listing 5.5 parallel_functions.py (run_conversation, API call)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", #1
messages=messages, #2
tools=tools, #2
tool_choice="auto", #3
)
response_message = response.choices[0].message #4
#1 LLMs that delegate to functions can be simpler models.
#2 Adds the messages and tools definitions
#3 auto is the default.
#4 The returned message from the LLM

## Page 183

At this point, after the API call, the response should hold the information
for the required function calls. Remember, we asked the LLM to provide
us with three recommendations, which means it should also provide us
with three function call outputs, as shown in the following listing.
Listing 5.6 parallel_functions.py (run_conversation, tool_calls)
tool_calls = response_message.tool_calls #1
if tool_calls: #1
available_functions = {
"recommend": recommend,
} #2
# Step 4: send the info for each function call and function response to
the model
for tool_call in tool_calls: #3
function_name = tool_call.function.name
function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]

)
messages.append( #5
{
"tool_call_id": tool_call.id,

#3 Loops through the calls and replays the content back to the LLM
#4 Executes the recommend function from extracted parameters
#5 Appends the results of each function call to the set of messages
#6 Sends another request to the LLM with updated information and returns the message reply
The tool call outputs and the calls to the recommender function results are
appended to the messages. Notice how messages now also contain the
history of the first call. This is then passed back to the LLM to construct a
reply in natural language.

Here are some recommendations for you:
1. Time travel movies: "Back to the Future"
2. Recipes: "The best thing you ever ate."
3. Gifts: "A glorious new..." (the recommendation was cut off, so I
couldn't provide the full recommendation)
I hope you find these recommendations helpful! Let me know if you need
more information.
This completes this simple demonstration. For more advanced applications,
the functions could do any number of things, from scraping websites to
calling search engines to completing far more complex tasks.
Functions are an excellent way to cast outputs for a particular task.
However, the work of handling functions or tools and making secondary
calls can be done in a cleaner and more efficient way. The following
section will uncover a more robust system of adding actions to agents.
5.3 Introducing Semantic Kernel
Semantic Kernel (SK) is another open source project from Microsoft
intended to help build AI applications, which we call agents. At its core,
the project is best used to define actions, or what the platform calls
semantic plugins, which are wrappers for skills and functions.
Figure 5.5 shows how the SK can be used as a plugin and a consumer of
OpenAI plugins. The SK relies on the OpenAI plugin definition to define a
plugin. That way, it can consume and publish itself or other plugins to
other systems.

## Page 185

Figure 5.5 How the Semantic Kernel integrates as a plugin and can also consume plugins
An OpenAI plugin definition maps precisely to the function definitions in
listing 5.4. This means that SK is the orchestrator of API tool calls, aka
plugins. That also means that SK can help organize multiple plugins with a
chat interface or an agent.
Note The team at SK originally labeled the functional modules as
skills. However, to be more consistent with OpenAI, they have since
renamed skills to plugins. What is more confusing is that the code still

## Page 186

uses the term skills. Therefore, throughout this chapter, we’ll use skills
and plugins to mean the same thing.
SK is a useful tool for managing multiple plugins (actions for agents) and,
as we’ll see later, can also assist with memory and planning tools. For this
chapter, we’ll focus on the actions/plugins. In the next section, we look at
how to get started using SK.
5.3.1 Getting started with SK semantic functions
SK is easy to install and works within Python, Java, and C#. This is
excellent news as it also allows plugins developed in one language to be
consumed in a different language. However, you can’t yet develop a native
function in one language and use it in another.
We’ll continue from where we left off for the Python environment using
the workspace in VS Code. Be sure you have a workspace
chapter_4
configured if you want to explore and run any examples.
Listing 5.8 shows how to install SK from a terminal within VS Code. You
can also install the SK extension for VS Code. The extension can be a
helpful tool to create plugins/skills, but it isn’t required.
Listing 5.8 Installing Semantic Kernel
pip uninstall semantic-kernel #1
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git #2
cd semantic-kernel/python #3
pip install -e . #4
#1 Uninstalls any previous installations of SK
#2 Clones the repository to a local folder
#3 Changes to the source folder
#4 Installs the editable package from the source folder
Once you finish the installation, open in VS Code.
SK_connecting.py
Listing 5.9 shows a demo of running an example quickly through SK. The
example creates a chat completion service using either OpenAI or Azure
OpenAI.

## Page 187

Listing 5.9 SK_connecting.py
import semantic_kernel as sk
selected_service = "OpenAI" #1
kernel = sk.Kernel() #2

api_key, org_id = sk.openai_settings_from_dot_env() #3
service_id = "oai_chat_gpt"
kernel.add_service(
OpenAIChatCompletion(
service_id=service_id,
ai_model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
api_key=api_key,
org_id=org_id,
),
)
elif selected_service == "AzureOpenAI":
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion
deployment, api_key, endpoint =
↪ sk.azure_openai_settings_from_dot_env() #4
service_id = "aoai_chat_completion"
kernel.add_service(
AzureChatCompletion(
service_id=service_id,

endpoint=endpoint,
api_key=api_key,
),
)
#This function is currently broken

result = await kernel.invoke_prompt(
↪ prompt="recommend a movie about
↪ time travel") #5
print(result)
# Use asyncio.run to execute the async function
asyncio.run(run_prompt()) #6
###Output
One highly recommended time travel movie is "Back to the Future" (1985)
directed by Robert Zemeckis. This classic film follows the adventures of
teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox)…

#6 Calls the function asynchronously

## Page 188

Run the example by pressing F5 (debugging), and you should see an output
similar to listing 5.9. This example demonstrates how a semantic function
can be created with SK and executed. A semantic function is the equivalent
of a prompt template in prompt flow, another Microsoft tool. In this
example, we define a simple prompt as a function.
It’s important to note that this semantic function isn’t defined as a plugin.
However, the kernel can create the function as a self-contained semantic
element that can be executed against an LLM. Semantic functions can be
used alone or registered as plugins, as you’ll see later. Let’s jump to the
next section, where we introduce contextual variables.
5.3.2 Semantic functions and context variables
Expanding on the previous example, we can look at adding contextual
variables to the semantic function. This pattern of adding placeholders to
prompt templates is one we’ll review over and over. In this example, we
look at a prompt template that has placeholders for subject, genre, format,
and custom.
Open in VS Code, as shown in the next listing.
SK_context_variables.py
The prompt is equivalent to setting aside a and section of the
system user
prompt.

## Page 189

Listing 5.10 SK_context_variables.py
#top section omitted…
prompt = """ #1
system:
You have vast knowledge of everything and can recommend anything provided
you are given the following criteria, the subject, genre, format and any
other custom information.

prompt_template_config = sk.PromptTemplateConfig( #2

###Output
One movie that fits the criteria of being about time travel, set in a
medieval period, and being a comedy is "The Visitors" (Les Visiteurs)
from 1993. This French film, directed by Jean-Marie Poiré, follows a
knight and his squire who are transported to the modern era by a
wizard’s spell gone wrong.…

#5 Sets the kernel function arguments
Go ahead and debug this example (F5), and wait for the output to be
generated. That is the basis for setting up SK and creating and exercising
semantic functions. In the next section, we move on to see how a semantic
function can be registered as a skill/plugin.
5.4 Synergizing semantic and native functions
Semantic functions encapsulate a prompt/profile and execute through
interaction with an LLM. Native functions are the encapsulation of code
that may perform anything from scraping websites to searching the web.
Both semantic and native functions can register as plugins/skills in the SK
kernel.
A function, semantic or native, can be registered as a plugin and used the
same way we registered the earlier function directly with our API calls.
When a function is registered as a plugin, it becomes accessible to chat or
agent interfaces, depending on the use case. The next section looks at how
a semantic function is created and registered with the kernel.
5.4.1 Creating and registering a semantic skill/plugin
The VS Code extension for SK provides helpful tools for creating
plugins/skills. In this section, we’ll use the SK extension to create a

## Page 191

plugin/skill and then edit the components of that extension. After that,
we’ll register and execute the plugin in the SK.
Figure 5.6 shows the process for creating a new skill within VS Code using
the SK extension. (Refer to appendix B for directions if you need to install
this extension.) You’ll then be given the option for the skill/plugin folder to
place the function. Always group functions that are similar together. After
creating a skill, enter the name and description of the function you want to
develop. Be sure to describe the function as if the LLM were going to use
it.

## Page 192

Figure 5.6 The process of creating a new skill/plugin
You can see the completed skills and functions by opening the
folder and reviewing the files. We’ll follow the previously
skills/plugin
constructed example, so open the

## Page 193

folder, as shown in figure 5.7.
skills/Recommender/Recommend_Movies
Inside this folder is a file, the function description, and the
config.json
semantic function/prompt in a file called .
skprompt.txt
Figure 5.7 The file and folder structure of a semantic function skill/plugin
Listing 5.11 shows the contents of the semantic function definition, also
known as the plugin definition. Note that the type is marked as
completion
and not of type because this is a semantic function. We would
function
define a native function as a type function.

## Page 194

Listing 5.11 Recommend_Movies/config.json
{
"schema": 1,
"type": "completion", #1
"description": "A function to recommend movies based on users list of
previously seen movies.",
"completion": { #2
"max_tokens": 256,
"temperature": 0,
"top_p": 0,
"presence_penalty": 0,
"frequency_penalty": 0
},
"input": {
"parameters": [
{
"name": "input", #3
"description": "The users list of previously seen movies.",
"defaultValue": ""
}
]
},
"default_backends": []
}
#1 Semantic functions are functions of type completion.
#2 We can also set the completion parameters for how the function is called.
#3 Defines the parameters input into the semantic function
Next, we can look at the definition of the semantic function prompt, as
shown in listing 5.12. The format is a little different, but what we see here
matches the earlier examples using templating. This prompt recommends
movies based on a list of movies the user has previously seen.
Listing 5.12 Recommend_Movies/skprompt.txt
You are a wise movie recommender and you have been asked to recommend a
movie to a user.
You are provided a list of movies that the user has watched before.
You want to recommend a movie that the user has not watched before.
[INPUT]
{{$input}}
[END INPUT]
Now, we’ll dive into the code that loads the skill/plugin and executes it in a
simple example. Open the file in VS Code. The
SK_first_skill.py
following listing shows an abridged version highlighting the new sections.

## Page 195

Listing 5.13 SK_first_skill.py (abridged listing)
kernel = sk.Kernel()
plugins_directory = "plugins"
recommender = kernel.import_plugin_from_prompt_directory(
plugins_directory,
"Recommender",
) #1
recommend = recommender["Recommend_Movies"]
seen_movie_list = [ #2
"Back to the Future",
"The Terminator",
"12 Monkeys",
"Looper",
"Groundhog Day",
"Primer",
"Donnie Darko",
"Interstellar",
"Time Bandits",
"Doctor Strange",
]
async def run():
result = await kernel.invoke(
recommend,
sk.KernelArguments( #3
settings=execution_settings, input=", ".join(seen_movie_list)
),
)
print(result)
asyncio.run(run()) #4
###Output
Based on the list of movies you've provided, it seems you have an
interest in science fiction, time travel, and mind-bending narratives.
Given that you've watched a mix of classics and modern films in this
genre, I would recommend the following movie that you have not watched
before:
"Edge of Tomorrow" (also known as "Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow")…
#1 Loads the prompt from the plugins folder
#2 List of user’s previously seen movies
#3 Input is set to joined list of seen movies.
#4 Function is executed asynchronously.
The code loads the skill/plugin from the directory and the
skills plugin
folder. When a skill is loaded into the kernel and not just created, it
becomes a registered plugin. That means it can be executed directly as is
done here or through an LLM chat conversation via the plugin interface.

## Page 196

Run the code (F5), and you should see an output like listing 5.13. We now
have a simple semantic function that can be hosted as a plugin. However,
this function requires users to input a complete list of movies they have
watched. We’ll look at a means to fix this by introducing native functions
in the next section.
5.4.2 Applying native functions
As stated, native functions are code that can do anything. In the following
example, we’ll introduce a native function to assist the semantic function
we built earlier.
This native function will load a list of movies the user has previously seen,
from a file. While this function introduces the concept of memory, we’ll
defer that discussion until chapter 8. Consider this new native function as
any code that could virtually do anything.
Native functions can be created and registered using the SK extension. For
this example, we’ll create a native function directly in code to make the
example easier to follow.
Open in VS Code. We’ll start by looking at how
SK_native_functions.py
the native function is defined. A native function is typically defined within
a class, which simplifies managing and instantiating native functions.

## Page 197

Listing 5.14 SK_native_functions.py (MySeenMovieDatabase)
class MySeenMoviesDatabase:
"""
Description: Manages the list of users seen movies. #1
"""
@kernel_function( #2
description="Loads a list of movies … user has already seen",
name="LoadSeenMovies",
)
def load_seen_movies(self) -> str: #3
try:
with open("seen_movies.txt", 'r') as file: #4
lines = [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()]
comma_separated_string = ', '.join(lines)
return comma_separated_string
except Exception as e:
print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
return None
#1 Provides a description for the container class
#2 Uses a decorator to provide function description and name
#3 The actual function returns a list of movies in a comma-separated string.
#4 Loads seen movies from the text file
With the native function defined, we can see how it’s used by scrolling
down in the file, as shown in the following listing.

## Page 198

plugins_directory = "plugins"
recommender = kernel.import_plugin_from_prompt_directory(
plugins_directory,

seen_movies_plugin = kernel.import_plugin_from_object(
MySeenMoviesDatabase(), "SeenMoviesPlugin"
) #2
load_seen_movies = seen_movies_plugin["LoadSeenMovies"] #3
async def show_seen_movies():
seen_movie_list = await load_seen_movies(kernel)
return seen_movie_list
seen_movie_list = asyncio.run(show_seen_movies()) #4
print(seen_movie_list)
async def run(): #5
result = await kernel.invoke(
recommend,
sk.KernelArguments(
settings=execution_settings,
input=seen_movie_list),
)
print(result)
asyncio.run(run()) #5
###Output
The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions, The Matrix
Resurrections – output from print statement
Based on your interest in the "The Matrix" series, it seems you enjoy
science fiction films with a strong philosophical undertone and action
elements. Given that you've watched all
#1 Loads the semantic function as shown previously
#2 Imports the skill into the kernel and registers the function as a plugin
#3 Loads the native function
#4 Executes the function and returns the list as a string
#5 Wraps the plugin call in an asynchronous function and executes
One important aspect to note is how the native function was imported into
the kernel. The act of importing to the kernel registers that function as a
plugin/skill. This means the function can be used as a skill from the kernel
through other conversations or interactions. We’ll see how to embed a
native function within a semantic function in the next section.

## Page 199

5.4.3 Embedding native functions within semantic functions
There are plenty of powerful features within SK, but one beneficial feature
is the ability to embed native or semantic functions within other semantic
functions. The following listing shows how a native function can be
embedded within a semantic function.
Listing 5.16 SK_semantic_native_functions.py (skprompt)
sk_prompt = """
You are a wise movie recommender and you have been asked to recommend a
movie to a user.
You have a list of movies that the user has watched before.
You want to recommend a movie that
the user has not watched before. #1
Movie List: {{MySeenMoviesDatabase.LoadSeenMovies}}. #2
"""
#1 The exact instruction text as previous
#2 The native function is referenced and identified by class name and function name.
The next example, , uses inline native
SK_semantic_native_functions.py
and semantic functions. Open the file in VS Code, and the following listing
shows the code to create, register, and execute the functions.

## Page 200

Listing 5.17 SK_semantic_native_functions.py (abridged)
prompt_template_config = sk.PromptTemplateConfig(
template=sk_prompt,
name="tldr",
template_format="semantic-kernel",
execution_settings=execution_settings,
) #1
recommend_function = kernel.create_function_from_prompt(
prompt_template_config=prompt_template_config,
function_name="Recommend_Movies",
plugin_name="Recommendation",
) #2
async def run_recommendation(): #3
recommendation = await kernel.invoke(
recommend_function,
sk.KernelArguments(),
)
print(recommendation)
# Use asyncio.run to execute the async function
asyncio.run(run_recommendation())
###Output
Based on the list provided, it seems the user is a fan of the Matrix
franchise. Since they have watched all four existing Matrix movies, I
would recommend a…
#1 Creates the prompt template config for the prompt
#2 Creates an inline semantic function from the prompt
#3 Executes the semantic function asynchronously
Run the code, and you should see an output like listing 5.17. One important
aspect to note is that the native function is registered with the kernel, but
the semantic function is not. This is important because function creation
doesn’t register a function.
For this example to work correctly, the native function must be registered
with the kernel, which uses the function call—the first line
import_plugin
in listing 5.17. However, the semantic function itself isn’t registered. An
easy way to register the function is to make it a plugin and import it.
These simple exercises showcase ways to integrate plugins and skills into
chat or agent interfaces. In the next section, we’ll look at a complete
example demonstrating adding a plugin representing a service or GPT
interface to a chat function.

## Page 201

5.5 Semantic Kernel as an interactive service
agent
In chapter 1, we introduced the concept of the GPT interface—a new
paradigm in connecting services and other components to LLMs via
plugins and semantic layers. SK provides an excellent abstraction for
converting any service to a GPT interface.
Figure 5.8 shows a GPT interface constructed around an API service called
The Movie Database (TMDB; www.themoviedb.org). The TMDB site
provides a free API that exposes information about movies and TV shows.
Figure 5.8 This layer architecture diagram shows the role of a GPT interface and the Semantic
Kernel being exposed to chat or agent interfaces.

## Page 202

To follow along with the exercises in this section, you must register for a
free account from TMDB and create an API key. Instructions for getting an
API key can be found at the TMDB website (www.themoviedb.org) or by
asking a GPT-4 turbo or a more recent LLM.
Over the next set of subsections, we’ll create a GPT interface using an SK
set of native functions. Then, we’ll use the SK kernel to test the interface
and, later in this chapter, implement it as plugins into a chat function. In
the next section, we look at building a GPT interface against the TMDB
API.
5.5.1 Building a semantic GPT interface
TMDB is an excellent service, but it provides no semantic services or
services that can be plugged into ChatGPT or an agent. To do that, we must
wrap the API calls that TMDB exposes in a semantic service layer.
A semantic service layer is a GPT interface that exposes functions through
natural language. As discussed, to expose functions to ChatGPT or other
interfaces such as agents, they must be defined as plugins. Fortunately, SK
can create the plugins for us automatically, given that we write our
semantic service layer correctly.
A native plugin or set of skills can act as a semantic layer. To create a
native plugin, create a new plugin folder, and put a Python file holding a
class containing the set of native functions inside that folder. The SK
extension currently doesn’t do this well, so manually creating the module
works best.
Figure 5.9 shows the structure of the new plugin called and the
Movies
semantic service layer called . For native functions, the parent
tmdb.py
folder’s name ( ) is used in the import.
Movies

## Page 203

Figure 5.9 The folder and file structure of the TMDB plugin
Open the file in VS Code, and look at the top of the file, as shown
tmdb.py
in listing 5.18. This file contains a class called , which
TMDbService
exposes several functions that map to API endpoint calls. The idea is to
map the various relevant API function calls in this semantic service layer.
This will expose the functions as plugins for a chat or agent interface.

## Page 204

from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_funct
import requests
import inspect
def print_function_call(): #1

)

base_url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3"
endpoint = f"{base_url}/genre/movie/list↪
↪ ?api_key={self.api_key}&language=en-US"
response = requests.get(endpoint) #4
if response.status_code == 200: #4
genres = response.json()['genres']
for genre in genres:
if genre_name.lower() in genre['name'].lower():
return str(genre['id']) #5
return None

The bulk of the code for the and the functions to call the
TMDbService
TMDB endpoints was written with the help of GPT-4 Turbo. Then, each
function was wrapped with the decorator to expose it
sk_function
semantically.
A few of the TMDB API calls have been mapped semantically. Listing
5.19 shows another example of a function exposed to the semantic service
layer. This function pulls a current top 10 list of movies playing for a
particular genre.

## Page 205

Listing 5.19 tmdb.py (get_top_movies_by_genre)
@kernel_function( #1
description="””
Gets a list of currently playing movies for a given genre””",
name="get_top_movies_by_genre",
input_description="The genre of the movies to get",
)
def get_top_movies_by_genre(self, genre: str) -> str:
print_function_call()
genre_id = self.get_movie_genre_id(genre) #2
if genre_id:
base_url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3
playing_movies_endpoint = f"{base_url}/movie/now_playing?↪
↪ api_key={self.api_key}&language=en-US"
response = requests.get(
playing_movies_endpoint) #3
if response.status_code != 200:
return ""
playing_movies = response.json()['results'
for movie in playing_movies: #4
movie['genre_ids'] = [str(genre_id)
↪ for genre_id in movie['genre_ids']]
filtered_movies = [movie for movie ↪
↪ in playing_movies if genre_id ↪
↪ in movie['genre_ids']][:10] #5
results = ", ".join([movie['title'] for movie in filtered_movies])
return results
else:
return ""
#1 Decorates the function with descriptions
#2 Finds the genre id for the given genre name
#3 Gets a list of currently playing movies
#4 Converts genre_ids to strings
#5 Checks to see if the genre id matches movie genres
Look through the various other API calls mapped semantically. As you can
see, there is a well-defined pattern for converting API calls to a semantic
service. Before we run the full service, we’ll test each of the functions in
the next section.
5.5.2 Testing semantic services
In a real-world application, you’ll likely want to write a complete set of
unit or integration tests for each semantic service function. We won’t do
that here; instead, we’ll write a quick helper script to test the various
functions.

## Page 206

Open in VS Code, and review the code, as shown
test_tmdb_service.py
in listing 5.20. You can comment and uncomment any functions to test
them in isolation. Be sure to have only one function uncommented at a
time.

The real power of SK is shown in this test. Notice how the
TMDbService
class is imported as a plugin, but we don’t have to define any plugin
configurations other than what we already did? By just writing one class
that wrapped a few API functions, we’ve exposed part of the TMDB API
semantically. Now, with the functions exposed, we can look at how they
can be used as plugins for a chat interface in the next section.
5.5.3 Interactive chat with the semantic service layer
With the TMDB functions exposed semantically, we can move on to
integrating them into a chat interface. This will allow us to converse
naturally in this interface to get various information, such as current top
movies.
Open in VS Code. Scroll down to the start of the
SK_service_chat.py
new section of code that creates the functions, as shown in listing 5.21. The
functions created here are now exposed as plugins, except we filter out the
chat function, which we don’t want to expose as a plugin. The chat
function here allows the user to converse directly with the LLM and
shouldn’t be a plugin.

## Page 209

Listing 5.21 SK_service_chat.py (function setup)
system_message = "You are a helpful AI assistant."
tmdb_service = kernel.import_plugin_from_object(
TMDbService(), "TMDBService") #1

) #4
history = ChatHistory()
history.add_system_message("You recommend movies and TV Shows.")
history.add_user_message("Hi there, who are you?")
history.add_assistant_message(
"I am Rudy, the recommender chat bot. I'm trying to figure out what

) #5

#2 Configures the execution settings and adds filtered tools
#3 Configures the prompt configuration
#4 Defines the input template and takes full strings as user input
#5 Adds the chat history object and populates some history
#6 Creates the chat function
Next, we can continue by scrolling in the same file to review the chat
function, as shown in the following listing.

## Page 210

Listing 5.22 SK_service_chat.py (chat function)
async def chat() -> bool:
try:
user_input = input("User:> ") #1
except KeyboardInterrupt:
print("\n\nExiting chat...")
return False
except EOFError:
print("\n\nExiting chat...")
return False
if user_input == "exit": #2
print("\n\nExiting chat...")
return False
arguments = sk.KernelArguments( #3
user_input=user_input,
history=("\n").join(
[f"{msg.role}: {msg.content}" for msg in history]),
)
result = await chat_completion_with_tool_call( #4

print(f"AI Agent:> {result}")
return True
#1 Input is taken directly from the terminal/console.
#2 If the user types exit, then exit the chat.
#3 Creates arguments to pass to the function
#4 Uses the utility function to call the function and execute the tool
Lastly, scroll down to the bottom of the file, and review the primary
function. This is the code that calls the chat function in a loop.
Listing 5.23 SK_service_chat.py (main function)
async def main() -> None:
chatting = True
context = kernel.create_new_context()
print("Welcome to your first AI Agent\ #1
\n Type 'exit' to exit.\
\n Ask to get a list of currently playing movies by genre."
)
while chatting: #2
chatting, context = await chat(context) #3
if __name__ == "__main__":
asyncio.run(main())
#1 Introduction to the user
#2 Continues until chatting is False
#3 Calls the chat function asynchronously

## Page 211

Run the chat interface, run the file (F5), and then ask about movies or
television shows of a particular genre. An example conversation session is
shown in listing 5.24. This output shows how a request to list movies from
two genres made the chat interface make multiple calls to the
function.
get_top_movie_by_genre
Listing 5.24 SK_service_chat.py (example conversation)
Welcome to your first AI Agent
Type 'exit' to exit.
Ask to get a list of currently playing movies by genre.
User:> Input: can you give me list of the current top playing movies for
the action and comedy genres?

Arguments:

#1 LLM makes two calls to get_top_movies_by_genre.
#2 Internal call to get the genre id

## Page 212

Be sure to explore the chat interface’s boundaries and what you can ask for
from the TMDB service. For example, try asking for a list of genres for
movies or television shows. This service is a good first try, but we can
perhaps do better, as we’ll see in the next section.
5.6 Thinking semantically when writing semantic
services
Now we’ve seen an excellent demonstration of converting an API into a
semantic service interface. As it is, the functions return the titles of the top
movies and television shows currently playing. However, by just returning
the titles, we’re limiting the ability of the LLM to parse the results on its
own.
Therefore, we’ll create a v2 version of to correct this and
TMDbService
return the results as JSON strings. Open the file in VS Code,
tmdb_v2.py
and scroll down to the function.
get_top_movies_by_genre
Listing 5.25 tmdb_v2.py (get_top_movies_by_genre)
def get_top_movies_by_genre(self, genre: str) -> str:
print_function_call()
genre_id = self.get_movie_genre_id(genre)
if genre_id:
#same code …
return json.dumps(filtered_movies) #1
else:
return ""
#1 Now returns a filtered list as a JSON string
Now open in VS Code, and comment and
SK_service_chat.py
uncomment the line shown in listing 5.26. This will then use version 2 of
the that outputs results as full JSON documents in a single
TMDbService
string.
Listing 5.26 SK_service_chat.py (modifying imports)
#from skills.Movies.tmdb import TMDbService #1
from skills.Movies.tmdb_v2 import TMDbService #2
#1 Comment out this line.
#2 Uncomment this line to use version 2 of the service.

## Page 213

Rerun the file in VS Code, and alter your query
SK_service_chat.py
slightly, as shown by the output in the following listing.
Listing 5.27 SK_service_chat.py (TMDb_v2 service output)
User:> get a list of currently playing movies for the
action genre and only return movies about space #1
Agent:> To find currently playing action movies that are specifically
about space, I will need to manually filter the provided list for those
that have space-related themes in their overview. Here's what fits that
criteria from the list:
1. **Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire** #2
- Release Date: 2023-12-15
- Overview: When a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy finds
itself threatened by the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius,
they dispatch Kora, a young woman with a mysterious past, to seek out
warriors from neighboring planets to help them take a stand.
This is the only movie from the provided list that clearly mentions a
space-related theme in its overview. …
#1 New query asks to include an additional filter for space
#2 The LLM calls the service and then reviews the returned results that match the filter.
Because the semantic service functions now return the complete movie
listing in JSON, the LLM can apply additional filtering. This is the real
power of semantic services, allowing you to process the data through the
LLM. We won’t see this power by just returning a list of titles.
This last exercise demonstrated the change in mentality you need to make
when writing semantic service layers. Generally, you’ll typically want to
return as much information as possible. Returning more information takes
advantage of the LLM abilities to filter, sort, and transform data
independently. In the next chapter, we’ll explore building autonomous
agents using behavior trees.

Summary
Agent actions extend the capabilities of an agent system, such as
ChatGPT. This includes the ability to add plugins to ChatGPT and
LLMs to function as proxies for actions.
OpenAI supports function definitions and plugins within an OpenAI
API session. This includes adding function definitions to LLM API
calls and understanding how these functions allow the LLM to perform
additional actions.
The Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open source project from Microsoft
that can be used to build AI applications and agent systems. This
includes the role of semantic plugins in defining native and semantic
functions.
Semantic functions encapsulate the prompt/profile template used to
engage an LLM.
Native functions encapsulate code that performs or executes an action
using an API or other interface.
Semantic functions can be combined with other semantic or native
functions and layered within one another as execution stages.
SK can be used to create a GPT interface over the top of API calls in a
semantic service layer and expose them as chat or agent interface

trees
Using back chaining to create behavior trees for complex systems
Now that we’ve covered how actions extend the power/capabilities of
agents, we can look at how behavior trees can guide agentic systems. We’ll
start by understanding the basics of behavior trees and how they control
robotics and AI in games.
We’ll return to agentic actions and examine how actions can be
implemented on the OpenAI Assistants platform using the GPT Assistants
Playground project. From there, we’ll look at how to build an autonomous
agentic behavior tree (ABT) using OpenAI assistants. Then, we’ll move on
to understanding the need for controls and guardrails on autonomous
agents and using control barrier functions.
In the final section of the chapter, we’ll examine the use of the AgentOps
platform to monitor our autonomous behavior-driven agentic systems. This
will be an exciting chapter with several challenges. Let’s begin by jumping
into the next section, which introduces behavior trees.
6.1 Introducing behavior trees
Behavior trees are a long-established pattern used to control robotics and
AI in games. Rodney A. Brooks first introduced the concept in his “A
Robust Layered Control System for a Mobile Robot” paper in 1986. This

## Page 218

laid the groundwork for a pattern that expanded on using the tree and node
structure we have today.
If you’ve ever played a computer game with nonplayer characters (NPCs)
or interacted with advanced robotic systems, you’ve witnessed behavior
trees at work. Figure 6.1 shows a simple behavior tree. The tree represents
all the primary nodes: selector or fallback nodes, sequence nodes, action
nodes, and condition nodes.
Figure 6.1 A simple behavior tree of eating an apple or a pear
Table 6.1 describes the functions and purpose of the primary nodes we’ll
explore in this book. There are other nodes and node types, and you can
even create custom nodes, but for now, we’ll focus on those in the table.

succeed to return success.
The primary nodes in table 6.1 can provide enough functionality to handle
numerous use cases. However, understanding behavior trees initially can
be daunting. You won’t appreciate their underlying complexity until you
start using them. Before we build some simple trees, we want to look at
execution in more detail in the next section.

## Page 220

6.1.1 Understanding behavior tree execution
Understanding how behavior trees execute is crucial to designing and
implementing behavior trees. Unlike most concepts in computer science,
behavior trees operate in terms of success and failure. When a node in a
behavior tree executes, it will return either success or failure; this even
applies to conditions and selector nodes.
Behavior trees execute from top to bottom and left to right. Figure 6.2
shows the process and what happens if a node fails or succeeds. In the
example, the AI the tree controls has an apple but no pear. In the first
sequence node, a condition checks if the AI has an apple. Because the AI
doesn’t have an apple, it aborts the sequence and falls back to the selector.
The selector then selects its next child node, another sequence, that checks
if the AI has a pear, and because it does, the AI eats the apple.

## Page 221

Figure 6.2 The execution process of a simple behavior tree
Behavior trees provide control over how an AI system will execute at a
macro or micro level. Regarding robotics, behavior trees will typically be
designed to operate at the micro level, where each action or condition is a
small event, such as detecting the apple. Conversely, behavior trees can
also control more macro systems, such as NPCs in games, where each
action may be a combination of events, like attacking the player.
For agentic systems, behavior trees support controlling an agent or
assistant at your chosen level. We’ll explore controlling agents at the task
and, in later chapters, the planning levels. After all, with the power of
LLMs, agents can construct their own behavior tree.
Of course, several other forms of AI control could be used to control
agentic systems. The next section will examine those different systems and
compare them to behavior trees.

## Page 222

6.1.2 Deciding on behavior trees
Numerous other AI control systems have benefits and are worth exploring
in controlling agentic systems. They can demonstrate the benefits of
behavior trees and provide other options for specific use cases. The
behavior tree is an excellent pattern, but it isn’t the only one, and it’s worth
learning about others.
Table 6.2 highlights several other systems we may consider for controlling
AI systems. Each item in the table describes what the method does, its
shortcomings, and its possible application to agentic AI control.

In later chapters of this book, we’ll investigate some of the patterns
discussed in table 6.2. Overall, several patterns can be enhanced or
incorporated using behavior trees as the base. While other patterns, such as
FSMs, may be helpful for small experiments, they lack the scalability of
behavior trees.
Behavior trees can provide several benefits as an AI control system,
including scalability. The following list highlights other notable benefits of
using behavior trees:
Modularity and reusability—Behavior trees promote a modular
approach to designing behaviors, allowing developers to create reusable
components. Nodes in a behavior tree can be easily reused across
different parts of the tree or even in different projects, enhancing
maintainability and reducing development time.
Scalability—As systems grow in complexity, behavior trees handle the
addition of new behaviors more gracefully than other methods, such as
FSMs. Behavior trees allow for the hierarchical organization of tasks,
making it easier to manage and understand large behavior sets.
Flexibility and extensibility—Behavior trees offer a flexible framework
where new nodes (actions, conditions, decorators) can be added without
drastically altering the existing structure. This extensibility makes it
straightforward to introduce new behaviors or modify existing ones to
adapt to new requirements.
Debugging and visualization—Behavior trees provide a clear and
intuitive visual representation of behaviors, which is beneficial for
debugging and understanding the decision-making process. Tools that
support behavior trees often include graphical editors that allow
developers to visualize and debug the tree structure, making it easier to
identify and fix problems.

## Page 225

Decoupling of decision logic—Behavior trees separate the decision-
making and execution logic, promoting a clear distinction between
high-level strategy and low-level actions. This decoupling simplifies
the design and allows for more straightforward modifications and
testing of specific behavior parts without affecting the entire system.
Having made a strong case for behavior trees, we should now consider
how to implement them in code. In the next section, we look at how to
build a simple behavior tree, using Python code.
6.1.3 Running behavior trees with Python and py_trees
Because behavior trees have been around for so long and have been
incorporated into many technologies, creating a sample demonstration is
very simple. Of course, the easiest way is to ask ChatGPT or your favorite
AI chat tool. Listing 6.1 shows the result of using a prompt to generate the
code sample and submitting figure 6.1 as the example tree. The final code
had to be corrected for simple naming and parameter errors.
Note All the code for this chapter can be found by downloading the
GPT Assistants Playground project at https://mng.bz/Ea0q.

## Page 226

The code in listing 6.1 represents the behavior tree in figure 6.1. You can
run this code as is or alter what the conditions return and then run the tree
again. You can also change the behavior tree by removing one of the
sequence nodes from the root selector.

## Page 227

Now that we have a basic understanding of behavior trees, we can move on
to working with agents/assistants. Before doing that, we’ll look at a tool to
help us work with OpenAI Assistants. This tool will help us wrap our first
ABTs around OpenAI Assistants.
6.2 Exploring the GPT Assistants Playground
For the development of this book, several GitHub projects were created to
address various aspects of building agents and assistants. One such project,
the GPT Assistants Playground, is built using Gradio for the interface that
mimics the OpenAI Assistants Playground but with several extras added.
The Playground project was developed as both a teaching and
demonstration aid. Inside the project, the Python code uses the OpenAI
Assistants API to create a chat interface and an agentic system to build and
power assistants. There is also a comprehensive collection of actions
assistants you can use, and you can easily add your own actions.
6.2.1 Installing and running the Playground
The following listing shows installing and running the Playground project
from the terminal. There is currently no PyPI package to install.
Listing 6.2 Installing the GPT Assistants Playground
# change to a working folder and create a new Python virtual environment

cd GPTAssistantsPlayground #2
pip install -r requirements.txt #3
#1 Pulls the source code from GitHub
#2 Changes directory to the project source code folder
#3 Installs the requirements
You can run the application from the terminal or using Visual Studio Code
(VS Code), with the latter giving you more control. Before running the
application, you need to set your OpenAI API key through the command
line or by creating an file, as we’ve done a few times already. Listing
.env
6.3 shows an example of setting the environment variable on Linux/Mac or
the Git Bash shell (Windows recommended) and running the application.

## Page 228

the OpenAI Assistants, you’ll see them in the Select Assistant dropdown.

various options and instructions you need. If you’ve visited the OpenAI
Playground, you’ve already experienced a similar interface.

## Page 230

GPT VS. AN ASSISTANT
OpenAI defines a GPT as the assistant you can run and use within the
ChatGPT interface. An assistant can only be consumed through the API
and requires custom code in most cases. When you run an assistant,
you’re charged according to the model token usage and any special
tools, including the Code Interpreter and files, whereas a GPT runs
within ChatGPT and is covered by account costs.
The reason for creating a local version of the Playground was an
exercise to demonstrate the code structure but also provide additional
features listed here:
Actions (custom actions)—Creating your own actions allows you to
add any functionality you want to an assistant. As we’ll see, the
Playground makes it very easy to create your own actions quickly.
Code runner—The API does come with a Code Interpreter, but it’s
relatively expensive ($.03 per run), doesn’t allow you to install your
modules, can’t run code interactively, and runs slowly. The
Playground will enable you to run Python code locally in an isolated
virtual environment. While not as secure as pushing code out to
Docker images, it does execute code windowed and out of process
better than other platforms.
Transparency and logging—The Playground provides for
comprehensive capturing of logs and will even show how the
assistant uses internal and external tools/actions. This can be an
excellent way to see what the assistant is doing behind the scenes.
Each of these features is covered in more detail over the next few sections.
We’ll start with a look at using and consuming actions in the next section.
6.2.2 Using and building custom actions
Actions and tools are the building blocks that empower agents and
assistants. Without access to tools, agents are functionless chatbots. The

## Page 231

OpenAI platform is a leader in establishing many of the patterns for tools,
as we saw in chapter 3.
The Playground provides several custom actions that can be attached to
assistants through the interface. In this next exercise, we’ll build a simple
assistant and attach a couple of custom actions to see what is possible.
Figure 6.4 shows the expanded Actions accordion, which displays many
available custom actions. Run the Playground from the terminal or
debugger, and create a new assistant. Then, select the actions shown in the
figure. After you’re done selecting the actions, scroll to the bottom, and
click Add Assistant to add the assistant. Assistants need to be created
before they can be used.

## Page 232

Figure 6.4 Selecting and using custom actions in the interface
After you create the assistant, you can ask it to list all available assistants.
Listing the assistants also gives you the IDs required to call the assistant.
You can also call other assistants and ask them to complete tasks in their
area of specialization.

## Page 233

Adding your custom actions is as simple as adding code to a file and
dropping it in the right folder. Open the
playground/assistant_actions
folder from the main project folder, and you’ll see several files that define
the various actions. Open the file in VS Code, as shown
file_actions.py
in listing 6.4.
Listing 6.4 playground/assistant_actions/file_actions.py
import os
from playground.actions_manager import agent_action
OUTPUT_FOLDER = "assistant_outputs"
@agent_action #1
def save_file(filename, content): #2
"""
Save content to a file. #3
:param filename: The name of the file including extension.
:param content: The content to save in the file.
"""
file_path = os.path.join(OUTPUT_FOLDER, filename)
with open(file_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
file.write(content)
print(f"File '{filename}' saved successfully.") #4
#1 This decorator automatically adds the function as an action.
#2 Give your functions clear names that align with the purpose.
#3 The description is what the assistant uses to determine the function, so document it well.
#4 Generally returns a message stating success or failure
You can add any custom action you want by placing the file in the
folder and decorating it with the
assistant_actions agent_action
decorator. Just make sure to give the function a good name and enter
quality documentation for how the function should be used. When the
Playground starts up, it loads all the actions in the folder that are decorated
correctly and have descriptions/documentation.
It’s that simple. You can add several custom actions as needed. In the next
section, we’ll look at a special custom action that allows the assistant to
run code locally.

## Page 234

6.2.3 Installing the assistants database
To run several of the examples in this chapter, you’ll need to install the
assistants database. Fortunately, this can be easily done through the
interface and just by asking agents. The upcoming instructions detail the
process for installing the assistants and are taken directly from the GPT
Assistants Playground README. You can install several of the demo
assistants located in the SQLite database:
assistants.db
1. Create a new assistant, or use an existing assistant.
2. Give the assistant the action (found under
create_manager_assistant
the Actions section).
3. Ask the assistant to create the manager assistant (i.e., “please create the
manager assistant”), and be sure to name the assistant “Manager
Assistant.”
4. Refresh your browser to reload the assistants selector.
5. Select the new Manager Assistant. This assistant has the instructions
and actions that will allow it to install assistants from the
database.
assistants.db
6. Talk to the Manager Assistant to give you a list of assistants to install,
or just ask the Manager Assistant to install all available assistants.
6.2.4 Getting an assistant to run code locally
Getting agents and assistants to generate and run executable code has a lot
of power. Unlike the Code Interpreter, running code locally provides
numerous opportunities to iterate and tune quickly. We saw this earlier with
AutoGen, where the agents could keep running the code until it worked as
expected.
In the Playground, it’s a simple matter to select the custom action
, as shown in figure 6.5. You’ll also want to choose the
run_code
action because it allows the assistant to
run_shell_command pip install
any required modules.

## Page 235

Figure 6.5 Selecting custom actions for the assistant to run Python code
You can now ask an assistant to generate and run the code to be sure it
works on your behalf. Try this out by adding the custom actions and asking
the assistant to generate and run code, as shown in figure 6.6. If the code

## Page 236

doesn’t work as expected, tell the assistant what problems you
encountered.
Figure 6.6 Getting the assistant to generate and run Python code

## Page 237

Again, the Python code running in the Playground creates a new virtual
environment in a project subfolder. This system works well if you’re not
running any operating system–level code or low-level code. If you need
something more robust, a good option is AutoGen, which uses Docker
containers to run isolated code.
Adding actions to run code or other tasks can make assistants feel like a
black box. Fortunately, the OpenAI Assistants API allows you to consume
events and see what the assistant is doing behind the scenes. In the next
section, we’ll see what this looks like.
6.2.5 Investigating the assistant process through logs
OpenAI added a feature into the Assistants API that allows you to listen to
events and actions chained through tool/action use. This feature has been
integrated into the Playground, capturing action and tool use when an
assistant calls another assistant.
We can try this by asking an assistant to use a tool and then open the log. A
great example of how you can do this is by giving an assistant the Code
Interpreter tool and then asking it to plot an equation. Figure 6.7 shows an
example of this exercise.

## Page 238

Figure 6.7 Internal assistant logs being captured
Usually, when the Assistant Code Interpreter tool is enabled, you don’t see
any code generation or execution. This feature allows you to see all tools
and actions used by the assistant as they happen. Not only is it an excellent

## Page 239

tool for diagnostics, but it also provides additional insights into the
functions of LLMs.
We haven’t reviewed the code to do all this because it’s extensive and will
likely undergo several changes. That being said, if you plan on working
with the Assistants API, this project is a good place to start. With the
Playground introduced, we can continue our journey into ABTs in the next
section.
6.3 Introducing agentic behavior trees
Agentic behavior trees (ABTs) implement behavior trees on assistant and
agent systems. The key difference between regular behavior trees and
ABTs is that they use prompts to direct actions and conditions. Because
prompts may return a high occurrence of random results, we could also
name these trees stochastic behavior trees, which do exist. For simplicity,
we’ll differentiate behavior trees used to control agents, referring to them
as agentic.
Next, we’ll undertake an exercise to create an ABT. The finished tree will
be written in Python but will require the setup and configuration of various
assistants. We’ll cover how to manage assistants using the assistants
themselves.
6.3.1 Managing assistants with assistants
Fortunately, the Playground can help us quickly manage and create the
assistants. We’ll first install the Manager Assistant, followed by installing
the predefined assistants. let’s get started with installing the Manager
Assistant using the following steps:
1. Open Playground in your browser, and create a new simple assistant or
use an existing assistant. If you need a new assistant, create it and then
select it.
2. With the assistant selected, open the Actions accordion, and select the
action. You don’t need to save; the
create_ manager_assistant
interface will update the assistant automatically.

## Page 240

3. Now, in the chat interface, prompt the assistant with the following:
“Please create the manager assistant.”
4. After a few seconds, the assistant will say it’s done. Refresh your
browser, and confirm that the Manager Assistant is now available. If,
for some reason, the new assistant isn’t shown, try restarting the Gradio
app itself.
The Manager Assistant is like an admin that has access to everything.
When engaging the Manager Assistant, be sure to be specific about your
requests. With the Manager Assistant active, you can now install new
assistants used in the book using the following steps:
1. Select the Manager Assistant. If you’ve modified the Manager
Assistant, you can delete it and reinstall it anytime. Although it’s
possible to have multiple Manager Assistants, it’s not recommended.
2. Ask the Manager Assistant what assistants can be installed by typing
the following in the chat interface:
Please list all the installable assistants.
3. Identify which assistant you want installed when you ask the Manager
Assistant to install it:
Please install the Python Coding Assistant.
You can manage and install any available assistants using the Playground.
You can also ask the Manager Assistant to save the definitions of all your
assistants as JSON:
Please save all the assistants as JSON to a file called assistants.json.
The Manager Assistant can access all actions, which should be considered
unique and used sparingly. When crafting assistants, it’s best to keep them
goal specific and limit the actions to just what they need. This not only
avoids giving the AI too many decisions but also avoids accidents or
mistakes caused by hallucinations.
As we go through the remaining exercises in this chapter, you’ll likely
need to install the required assistants. Alternatively, you can ask the

## Page 241

Manager Assistant to install all available assistants. Either way, we look at
creating an ABT with assistants in the next section.
6.3.2 Building a coding challenge ABT
Coding challenges provide a good baseline for testing and evaluating agent
and assistant systems. Challenges and benchmarks can quantify how well
an agent or agentic system operates. We already applied coding challenges
to multi-platform agents in chapter 4 with AutoGen and CrewAI.
For this coding challenge, we’re going a little further and looking at
Python coding challenges from the Edabit site (https://edabit.com), which
range in complexity from beginner to expert. We’ll stick with the expert
code challenges because GPT-4o and other models are excellent coders.
Look at the challenge in the next listing, and think about how you would
solve it.

## Page 242

Listing 6.5 Edabit challenge: Plant the Grass
Plant the Grass by AniXDownLoe
You will be given a matrix representing a field g
and two numbers x, y coordinate.
There are three types of possible characters in the matrix:
x representing a rock.
o representing a dirt space.
+ representing a grassed space.
You have to simulate grass growing from the position (x, y).
Grass can grow in all four directions (up, left, right, down).
Grass can only grow on dirt spaces and can't go past rocks.
Return the simulated matrix.
Examples
simulate_grass([
"xxxxxxx",
"xooooox",
"xxxxoox"
"xoooxxx"
"xxxxxxx"
], 1, 1) → [
"xxxxxxx",
"x+++++x",
"xxxx++x"
"xoooxxx"
"xxxxxxx"
]
Notes
There will always be rocks on the perimeter
You can use any challenge or coding exercise you want, but here are a few
things to consider:
The challenge should be testable with quantifiable assertions (pass/fail).
Avoid opening windows when asking for a game, building a website, or
using another interface. At some point, testing full interfaces will be
possible, but for now, it’s just text output.
Avoid long-running challenges, at least initially. Start by keeping the
challenges concise and short lived.
Along with any challenge, you’ll also want a set of tests or assertions to
confirm the solution works. On Edabit, a challenge typically provides a
comprehensive set of tests. The following listing shows the additional tests
provided with the challenge.

## Page 243

Listing 6.6 Plant the Grass tests
Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass(
["xxxxxxx","xooooox","xxxxoox","xoooxxx","xxxxxxx"],
1, 1),
["xxxxxxx","x+++++x","xxxx++x","xoooxxx","xxxxxxx"])
Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass(
["xxxxxxx","xoxooox","xxoooox","xooxxxx",
"xoxooox","xoxooox","xxxxxxx"],
2, 3), ["xxxxxxx","xox+++x","xx++++x","x++xxxx",
"x+xooox","x+xooox","xxxxxxx"])
Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass(
["xxxxxx","xoxoox","xxooox","xoooox","xoooox","xxxxxx"],
1, 1),
["xxxxxx","x+xoox","xxooox","xoooox","xoooox","xxxxxx"])
Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass(
["xxxxx","xooox","xooox","xooox","xxxxx"],
1, 1),
["xxxxx","x+++x","x+++x","x+++x","xxxxx"])
Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass(
["xxxxxx","xxxxox","xxooox","xoooxx","xooxxx",
"xooxxx","xxooox","xxxoxx","xxxxxx"],
4, 1),
["xxxxxx","xxxx+x","xx+++x","x+++xx","x++xxx",
"x++xxx","xx+++x","xxx+xx","xxxxxx"])
Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass(
["xxxxxxxxxxx", "xoxooooooox", "xoxoxxxxxox",
"xoxoxoooxox", "xoxoxoxoxox", "xoxoxoxoxox",
"xoxoxxxoxox", "xoxoooooxox", "xoxxxxxxxox",
"xooooooooox", "xxxxxxxxxxx"], 1, 1),
["xxxxxxxxxxx", "x+x+++++++x", "x+x+xxxxx+x",
"x+x+x+++x+x", "x+x+x+x+x+x", "x+x+x+x+x+x",
"x+x+xxx+x+x", "x+x+++++x+x", "x+xxxxxxx+x",
"x+++++++++x", "xxxxxxxxxxx"])
The tests will be run as part of a two-step verification to confirm that the
solution works. We’ll also use the tests and challenges as written, which
will further test the AI.
Figure 6.8 shows the makeup of a straightforward behavior tree that will be
used to solve various programming challenges. You’ll notice that this ABT
uses a different assistant for the actions and conditions. For the first step,
the Python coding assistant (called the Hacker) generates a solution that is
then reviewed by the coding challenge Judge (called the Judge), which
produces a refined solution that is verified by a different Python coding
assistant (called the Verifier).

## Page 244

Figure 6.8 The ABT for the coding challenge
Figure 6.8 also shows how each agent converses on which thread.
Assistants use message threads, similar to a Slack or Discord channel,
where all assistants conversing on a thread will see all messages. For this
ABT, we keep one main conversation thread for the Hacker and Judge to
share messages, while the Verifier works on a separate message thread.
Keeping the Verifier on its own thread isolates it from the noise of the
solution-solving efforts.

## Page 245

Now, building the ABT in code is a matter of combining the
py_trees
package and the Playground API functions. Listing 6.7 shows an excerpt of
code that creates each of the action/condition nodes with the assistants and
gives them the instructions.

## Page 246

#13 The process will continue until the verification succeeds.
Run the ABT by loading the file in VS Code or using the command line.
Follow the output in the terminal, and watch how the assistants work
through each step in the tree.
If the solution fails to be verified at the condition node, the process will
continue per the tree. Even with this simple solution, you could quickly
create numerous variations. You could extend the tree with more
nodes/steps and subtrees. Perhaps you want a team of Hackers to break
down and analyze the challenge, for example.
This example’s work is done mainly with the Playground code, using the
helper functions and
create_assistant_condition
. This code uses a couple of classes
create_assistant_action_on_thread
to integrate the behavior tree code and the OpenAI Assistants
py_trees
code wrapped in the Playground. Review the code within the project if you
want to understand the lower-level details.

## Page 248

6.3.3 Conversational AI systems vs. other methods
We already looked at conversational multi-agent systems in chapter 4 when
we looked at AutoGen. The ABT can work using a combination of
conversations (over threads) and other methods, such as file sharing.
Having your assistants/agents pass files around helps reduce the number of
noisy and repetitive thoughts/conversations. In contrast, conversational
systems benefit from potential emergent behaviors. So, using both can help
evolve better control and solutions.
The simple solution in listing 6.7 could be extended to handle more real-
world coding challenges and perhaps even to work as a coding ABT. In the
next section, we build a different ABT to handle a different problem.
6.3.4 Posting YouTube videos to X
In this section’s exercise, we look at an ABT that can do the following:
1. Search for videos on YouTube for a given topic and return the latest
videos.
2. Download the transcripts for all the videos your search provided.
3. Summarize the transcripts.
4. Review the summarized transcripts and select a video to write an X
(formerly Twitter) post about.
5. Write an exciting and engaging post about the video, ensuring it’s less
than 280 characters.
6. Review the post and then post it on X.
Figure 6.9 shows the ABT assembled with each of the different assistants.
In this exercise, we use a sequence node for the root, and each assistant
performs a different action. Also, to keep things simple, each assistant
interaction will always occur in a new thread. This isolates each assistant’s
interaction into a concise conversation that’s easier to debug if something
goes wrong.

## Page 249

6.3.5 Required X setup
If you plan to run the code in this exercise, you must add your X
credentials to the file. The file shows an example of
.env .env.default
how the credentials need to be, as shown in listing 6.8. You don’t have to
enter your credentials. This means the last step, posting, will fail, but you
can still look at the file ( ) to see what was
youtube_twitter_post.txt
generated.

## Page 250

Listing 6.8 Configuring credentials
X_EMAIL = "twitter email here"
X_USERNAME = "twitter username here"
X_PASSWORD = "twitter password here"
YOUTUBE SEARCH AND SPAM
If you plan to run this exercise for real and let it post to your X account,
be aware that YouTube has a bit of a spam problem. The assistants have
been configured to try to avoid video spam, but some of it may get
through. Building a working ABT that can wade through videos while
avoiding spam has some suitable applications.
Listing 6.9 shows just the code for creating the assistant actions. This ABT
uses three different assistants, each with its own task instructions. Note that
each assistant has a unique set of instructions defining its role. You can
review the instructions for each assistant by using the Playground.

Run the code as you normally would, and after a few minutes, a new post
will appear in the folder. Figure 6.10 shows an
assistants_output
example of a post generated using this ABT. Running this ABT to generate
more than a few posts a day could, and likely will, get your X account
blocked. If you’ve configured X credentials, you’ll see the post appear on
your feed.

## Page 252

Figure 6.10 A sample X post from the ABT
This ABT is shown for demonstration purposes and isn’t for production or
long-term use. The primary features of this demonstration are to show
search and loading data, summarization and filtering, then generating new
content, and finally highlighting multiple custom actions and integrations
with APIs.
6.4 Building conversational autonomous multi-
agents
The conversational aspect of multi-agent systems can drive mechanisms
such as feedback, reasoning, and emergent behaviors. Driving agents with
ABTs that silo assistants/agents can be effective for controlling structured

## Page 253

processes, as we saw in the YouTube posting example. However, we also
don’t want to miss out on the benefits of conversation across
agents/assistants.
Fortunately, the Playground provides methods to silo or join assistants to
conversation threads. Figure 6.11 shows how assistants can be siloed or
mixed in various combinations to threads. Combining silos with
conversation provides the best of both patterns.
Figure 6.11 The various layouts of siloed and conversational assistants

## Page 254

We’ll examine a simple but practical exercise to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the conversational pattern. For the next exercise, we’ll
employ two assistants in an ABT that converse over the same thread. The
next listing shows the tree’s construction in code with the respective
assistants.
Listing 6.10 agentic_conversation_btree.py
root = py_trees.composites.Sequence("RootSequence", memory=True)
bug_file = """
# code not shown
"""
thread = api.create_thread() #1
debug_code = create_assistant_action_on_thread( #2

assistant_instructions=textwrap.dedent(f"""
Here is the code with bugs in it:

)
root.add_child(debug_code)
verify = create_assistant_condition_on_thread( #3
thread=thread,
condition_name="Verify",
assistant_name="Python Coding Assistant",
assistant_instructions=textwrap.dedent(
"""
Verify the solution fixes the bug and there are no more issues.
Verify that no exceptions are thrown when the code is run.
Reply with SUCCESS if the solution is correct, otherwise return FAILURE.
If you are happy with the solution, save the code to a file called
fixed_bug.py.
""",
),
)
root.add_child(verify)
tree = py_trees.trees.BehaviourTree(root)
while True:
tree.tick()
if root.status == py_trees.common.Status.SUCCESS:
break #4
time.sleep(20)
#1 Creates a message thread for the assistants to share and converse over
#2 Creates the debug code action with a special assistant
#3 Creates the verification condition to test if the code is fixed or not
#4 The tree will continue to run until the root sequence completes with success.

## Page 255

Three nodes comprise the tree: the root sequence, the debug code action,
and the verify fix condition. Because the tree’s root is a sequence, the two
assistants will continue to work one after another until they both return
with success. Both assistants converse on the same thread and yet are
controlled in a manner that provides constant feedback.
Run the exercise by loading the file in VS Code, or execute it directly from
the command line. The example code has a few minor bugs and problems
that the assistants will work through to fix. After the ABT completes
running successfully, you can open the
assistants_output/fixed_bug.py
file and verify the results are all good.
We’ve now seen a couple of ABTs in action and understand the nuances of
using silos or conversations. The following section will teach you some
techniques for building your own ABTs.
6.5 Building ABTs with back chaining
Back chaining is a method derived from logic and reasoning used to help
build behavior trees by working backward from the goal. This section will
use the back chaining process to construct an ABT that works to achieve
the goal. The following list provides a description of the process in more
detail:
1. Identify goal behavior. Start with the behavior you want the agent to
perform.
2. Determine the required actions. Identify the actions that lead to the goal
behavior.
3. Identify the conditions. Determine the conditions that must be met for
each action to succeed.
4. Determine the mode of communication. Determine how the assistants
will pass on information. Will the assistants be siloed or converse over
threads, or is a combination of patterns better?
5. Construct the tree. Start by building the behavior tree from the goal
behavior, adding nodes for actions and conditions recursively until all
necessary conditions are linked to known states or facts.

## Page 256

Behavior trees typically use a pattern called the blackboard to
communicate across nodes. Blackboards, like those in , use a
py_trees
key/value store to save information and make it accessible across nodes. It
also provides for several controls, such as limiting access to specific nodes.
We deferred to using files for communication because of their simplicity
and transparency. At some point, agentic systems are expected to consume
much more information and in different formats than those designed for
blackboards. Blackboards must either become more sophisticated or be
integrated with file storage solutions.
Let’s build an ABT using back chaining. We could tackle a variety of
goals, but one interesting and perhaps meta goal is to build an ABT that
helps build assistants. So let’s first present our goal as a statement “Create
an assistant that can help me do {task}”:
Required actions: (working backwards)
Create an assistant.
Verify the assistant.
Test the assistant.
Name the assistant.
Give the assistant the relevant instructions.
Identified condition:
Verify the assistant.
Determine communication patterns: To keep things interesting, we’ll
run all assistants on the same message thread.
Construct the tree: To construct the tree, let’s first reverse the order of
actions and mark each of the element’s actions and conditions
accordingly:
(action) Give the assistant relevant instructions to help a user with a
given task.
(action) Name the assistant.
(action) Test the assistant.
(condition) Verify the assistant.
(action) Create the assistant.

## Page 257

Of course, the simple solution to building the tree now is to ask ChatGPT
or an otherwise capable model. The result of asking ChatGPT to make the
tree is shown in the next listing. You could also work the tree out
independently and perhaps introduce other elements.
Listing 6.11 ABT for building an assistant
Root
│
├── Sequence
│ ├── Action: Give the assistant relevant instructions to help a user
with a given task
│ ├── Action: Name the assistant
│ ├── Action: Test the assistant
│ ├── Condition: Verify the assistant
│ └── Action: Create the assistant
From this point, we can start building the tree by iterating over each action
and condition node and determining what instructions the assistant needs.
This can also include any tools and custom actions, including ones you
may need to develop. On your first pass, keep the instructions generic.
Ideally, we want to create as few assistants as necessary.
After determining the assistant, tools, and actions for each assistant and for
which task, you can try to generalize things further. Think about where it
may be possible to combine actions and reduce the number of assistants.
It’s better to start evaluating with insufficient assistants than with too
many. However, be sure to maintain the proper divisions of work as tasks:
for example, testing and verification are best done with different assistants.

Summary
Behavior trees are a robust and scalable AI control pattern, first
introduced in robotics by Rodney A. Brooks. They are widely used in
gaming and robotics for their modularity and reusability.
The primary nodes in behavior trees are the selector, sequence,
condition, action, decorator, and parallel nodes. Selectors are like “or”
blocks: sequence executes nodes in sequence, condition tests the state,
action does the work, decorator is a wrapper, and parallel nodes allow
for dual execution.
Understanding the execution flow of behavior trees can be critical to
designing, building, and operating them to provide control for making
clear decision-making paths.
The advantages of behavior trees include modularity, scalability,
flexibility, debugging ease, and decoupling of decision logic, making
behavior trees suitable for complex AI systems.
Setting up and running a simple behavior tree in Python requires
correctly naming and documenting custom nodes.
The GPT Assistants Playground project is a Gradio-based interface that
mimics the OpenAI Assistants Playground with additional features for
teaching and demonstrating ABTs.
The GPT Assistants Playground allows for creating and managing
custom actions, which is essential for building versatile assistants.
ABTs control agents and assistants by using prompts to direct actions
and conditions for assistants. ABTs use the power of LLMs to create
dynamic and autonomous systems.
Back chaining is a method for constructing behavior trees by working
backward from the goal behavior. This process involves identifying
required actions, conditions, and communication patterns, and then
constructing the tree step by step.
Agentic systems benefit from siloed and conversation patterns for
communicating between entities. ABTs can benefit from combining
siloed and conversational assistants to use structured processes and
emergent behaviors.

7 Assembling and using an agent
platform
This chapter covers
Nexus chat and dashboard interface for AI agents
Streamlit framework for building intelligent dashboards, prototypes,
and AI chat apps
Developing, testing, and engaging agent profiles and personas in
Nexus
Developing the base Nexus agent
Developing, testing, and engaging agent actions and tools alone or
within Nexus
After we explored some basic concepts about agents and looked at using
actions with tools to build prompts and personas using frameworks such as
the Semantic Kernel (SK), we took the first steps toward building a
foundation for this book. That foundation is called Nexus, an agent
platform designed to be simple to learn, easy to explore, and powerful
enough to build your agent systems.
7.1 Introducing Nexus, not just another agent
platform
There are more than 100 AI platforms and toolkits for consuming and
developing large language model (LLM) applications, ranging from
toolkits such as SK or LangChain to complete platforms such as AutoGen
and CrewAI. This makes it difficult to decide which platform is well suited
to building your own AI agents.
Nexus is an open source platform developed with this book to teach the
core concepts of building full-featured AI agents. In this chapter, we’ll

## Page 263

examine how Nexus is built and introduce two primary agent components:
profiles/personas and actions/tools.
Figure 7.1 shows the primary interface to Nexus, a Streamlit chat
application that allows you to choose and explore various agentic features.
The interface is similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, and other commercial LLM
applications.

## Page 264

Figure 7.1 The Nexus interface and features
In addition to the standard features of an LLM chat application, Nexus
allows the user to configure an agent to use a specific API/model, the
persona, and possible actions. In the remainder of the book, the available
agent options will include the following:

## Page 265

Personas/profiles—The primary persona and profile the agent will use.
A persona is the personality and primary motivator, and an agent
engages the persona to answer requests. We’ll look in this chapter at
how personas/profiles can be developed and consumed.
Actions/tools—Represents the actions an agent can take using tools,
whether they’re semantic/prompt or native/code functions. In this
chapter, we’ll look at how to build both semantic and native functions
within Nexus.
Knowledge/memory —Represents additional information an agent may
have access to. At the same time, agent memory can represent various
aspects, from short-term to semantic memory.
Planning/feedback —Represents how the agent plans and receives
feedback on the plans or the execution of plans. Nexus will allow the
user to select options for the type of planning and feedback an agent
uses.
As we progress through this book, Nexus will be added to support new
agent features. However, simultaneously, the intent will be to keep things
relatively simple to teach many of these essential core concepts. In the next
section, we’ll look at how to quickly use Nexus before going under the
hood to explore features in detail.
7.1.1 Running Nexus
Nexus is primarily intended to be a teaching platform for all levels of
developers. As such, it will support various deployment and usage options.
In the next exercise, we’ll introduce how to get up and running with Nexus
quickly.
Open a terminal to a new Python virtual environment (version 3.10). If you
need assistance creating one, refer to appendix B. Then, execute the
commands shown in listing 7.1 within this new environment. You can
either set the environment variable at the command line or create a new
file and add the setting.
.env

## Page 266

Listing 7.1 Terminal command line
pip install git+https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/Nexus.git #1
#set your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=”< your API key>” #2
or
$env: OPENAI_API_KEY = =”< your API key>” #2
or
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="<your API key>"' > .env #2
nexus run #3
#1 Installs the package directly from the repository and branch; be sure to include the branch.
#2 Creates the key as an environment variable or creates a new .env file with the setting
#3 Runs the application
After entering the last command, a website will launch with a login page,
as shown in figure 7.2. Go ahead and create a new user. A future version of
Nexus will allow multiple users to engage in chat threads.

## Page 267

Figure 7.2 Logging in or creating a new Nexus user
After you log in, you’ll see a page like figure 7.1. Create a new chat and
start conversing with an agent. If you encounter a problem, be sure you
have the API key set properly. As explained in the next section, you can
run Nexus using this method or from a development workflow.
7.1.2 Developing Nexus
While working through the exercises of this book, you’ll want to set up
Nexus in development mode. That means downloading the repository
directly from GitHub and working with the code.
Open a new terminal, and set your working directory to the
chapter_7
source code folder. Then, set up a new Python virtual environment (version

## Page 268

3.10) and enter the commands shown in listing 7.2. Again, refer to
appendix B if you need assistance with any previous setup.
Listing 7.2 Installing Nexus for development
git clone https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/Nexus.git #1
pip install -e Nexus #2
#set your OpenAI API Key (.env file is recommended)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=”< your API key>” #bash #3
or
$env: OPENAI_API_KEY = =”< your API key>” #powershell #3
or
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="<your API key>"' > .env #3
nexus run #4
#1 Downloads and installs the specific branch from the repository
#2 Installs the downloaded repository as an editable package
#3 Sets your OpenAI key as an environment variable or adds it to an .env file
#4 Starts the application
Figure 7.3 shows the Login or Create New User screen. Create a new user,
and the application will log you in. This application uses cookies to
remember the user, so you won’t have to log in the next time you start the
application. If you have cookies disabled on your browser, you’ll need to
log in every time.

## Page 269

Figure 7.3 The Login or Create New User page
Go to the Nexus repository folder and look around. Figure 7.4 shows an
architecture diagram of the application’s main elements. At the top, the
interface developed with Streamlit connects the rest of the system through

## Page 270

the chat system. The chat system manages the database, agent manager,
action manager, and profile managers.

## Page 271

[No extractable text]

## Page 272

Figure 7.4 A high-level architecture diagram of the main elements of the application
This agent platform is written entirely in Python, and the web interface
uses Streamlit. In the next section, we look at how to build an OpenAI
LLM chat application.
7.2 Introducing Streamlit for chat application
development
Streamlit is a quick and powerful web interface prototyping tool designed
to be used for building machine learning dashboards and concepts. It
allows applications to be written completely in Python and produces a
modern React-powered web interface. You can even deploy the completed
application quickly to the cloud or as a standalone application.
7.2.1 Building a Streamlit chat application
Begin by opening Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to the source
chapter_07
folder. If you’ve completed the previous exercise, you should already be
ready. As always, if you need assistance setting up your environment and
tools, refer to appendix B.
We’ll start by opening the file in VS Code.
chatgpt_clone_response.py
The top section of the code is shown in listing 7.3. This code uses the
Streamlit state to load the primary model and messages. Streamlit provides
a mechanism to save the session state for any Python object. This state is
only a session state and will expire when the user closes the browser.

## Page 273

Listing 7.3 chatgpt_clone_response.py (top section)
import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
load_dotenv() #1
st.title("ChatGPT-like clone")
client = OpenAI() #2
if "openai_model" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state["openai_model"]
= "gpt-4-1106-preview" #3
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state["messages"] = [] #4
for message in st.session_state["messages"]: #5
with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
st.markdown(message["content"])
#1 Loads the environment variables from the .env file
#2 Configures the OpenAI client
#3 Checks the internal session state for the setting, and adds it if not there
#4 Checks for the presence of the message state; if none, adds an empty list
#5 Loops through messages in the state and displays them
The Streamlit app itself is stateless. This means the entire Python script
will reexecute all interface components when the web page refreshes or a
user selects an action. The Streamlit state allows for a temporary storage
mechanism. Of course, a database needs to support more long-term
storage.
UI controls and components are added by using the prefix and then the
st.
element name. Streamlit supports several standard UI controls and supports
images, video, sound, and, of course, chat.
Scrolling down further will yield listing 7.4, which has a slightly more
complex layout of the components. The main statement controls the
if
running of the remaining code. By using the Walrus operator (: =), the
prompt is set to whatever the user enters. If the user doesn’t enter any text,
the code below the statement doesn’t execute.
if

## Page 274

Listing 7.4 chatgpt_clone_response.py (bottom section)
if prompt := st.chat_input("What do you need?"): #1
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
with st.chat_message("user"): #2
st.markdown(prompt)
with st.spinner(text="The assistant is thinking..."): #3
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model=st.session_state["openai_model"],
messages=[
{"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
for m in st.session_state.messages
], #4
)
response_content = response.choices[0].message.content
response = st.markdown(response_content,
unsafe_allow_html=True) #5
st.session_state.messages.append(
{"role": "assistant", "content": response_content}) #6
#1 The chat input control is rendered, and content is set.
#2 Sets the chat message control to output as the user
#3 Shows a spinner to represent the long-running API call
#4 Calls the OpenAI API and sets the message history
#5 Writes the message response as markdown to the interface
#6 Adds the assistant response to the message state
When the user enters text in the prompt and presses Enter, that text is
added to the message state, and a request is made to the API. As the
response is being processed, the control displays to remind the
st.spinner
user of the long-running process. Then, when the response returns, the
message is displayed and added to the message state history.
Streamlit apps are run using the module, and to debug applications, you
need to attach the debugger to the module by following these steps:
1. Press Ctrl-Shift-D to open the VS Code debugger.
2. Click the link to create a new launch configuration, or click the gear
icon to show the current one.
3. Edit or use the debugger configuration tools to edit the
file, like the one shown in the next listing.
.vscode/launch.json
Plenty of IntelliSense tools and configuration options can guide you
through setting the options for this file.

## Page 275

Listing 7.5 .vscode/launch.json
{
"version": "0.2.0",
"configurations": [
{
"name": "Python Debugger: Module", #1
"type": "debugpy",
"request": "launch",
"module": "streamlit", #2
"args": ["run", "${file}"] #3
}
]
}
#1 Make sure that the debugger is set to Module.
#2 Be sure the module is streamlit.
#3 The ${file} is the current file, or you can hardcode this to a file path.
After you have the file configuration set, save it, and open
launch.json
the file in VS Code. You can now run the
chatgpt_ clone_response.py
application in debug mode by pressing F5. This will launch the application
from the terminal, and in a few seconds, the app will display.
Figure 7.5 shows the app running and waiting to return a response. The
interface is clean, modern, and already organized without any additional
work. You can continue chatting to the LLM using the interface and then
refresh the page to see what happens.

## Page 276

Figure 7.5 The simple interface and the waiting spinner
What is most impressive about this demonstration is how easy it is to
create a single-page application. In the next section, we’ll continue looking
at this application but with a few enhancements.
7.2.2 Creating a streaming chat application
Modern chat applications, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, mask the
slowness of their models by using streaming. Streaming provides for the
API call to immediately start seeing tokens as they are produced from the

## Page 277

LLM. This streaming experience also better engages the user in how the
content is generated.
Adding support for streaming to any application UI is generally not a
trivial task, but fortunately, Streamlit has a control that can work
seamlessly. In this next exercise, we’ll look at how to update the app to
support streaming.
Open in VS Code. The relevant
chapter_7/chatgpt_clone_streaming.py
updates to the code are shown in listing 7.6. Using the
st.write_stream
control allows the UI to stream content. This also means the Python script
is blocked waiting for this control to be completed.
Listing 7.6 chatgpt_clone_streaming.py (relevant section)
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
model=st.session_state["openai_model"],
messages=[
{"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
for m in st.session_state.messages
],
stream=True, #1
)
response = st.write_stream(stream) #2
st.session_state.messages.append(
{"role": "assistant", "content": response}) #3
#1 Sets stream to True to initiate streaming on the API
#2 Uses the stream control to write the stream to the interface
#3 Adds the response to the message state history after the stream completes
Debug the page by pressing F5 and waiting for the page to load. Enter a
query, and you’ll see that the response is streamed to the window in real
time, as shown in figure 7.6. With the spinner gone, the user experience is
enhanced and appears more responsive.

## Page 278

Figure 7.6 The updated interface with streaming of the text response
This section demonstrated how relatively simple it can be to use Streamlit
to create a Python web interface. Nexus uses a Streamlit interface because

## Page 279

it’s easy to use and modify with only Python. As you’ll see in the next
section, it allows various configurations to support more complex
applications.
7.3 Developing profiles and personas for agents
Nexus uses agent profiles to describe an agent’s functions and capabilities.
Figure 7.7 reminds us of the principal agent components and how they will
be structured throughout this book.

## Page 280

Figure 7.7 The agent profile as it’s mapped to the YAML file definition
For now, as of this writing, Nexus only supports the persona and actions
section of the profile. Figure 7.7 shows a profile called Fritz, along with
the persona and actions. Add any agent profiles to Nexus by copying an
agent YAML profile file into the
Nexus/
folder.
nexus/nexus_base/nexus_profiles

## Page 281

Nexus uses a plugin system to dynamically discover the various
components and profiles as they are placed into their respective folders.
The folder holds the YAML definitions for the agent.
nexus_profiles
We can easily define a new agent profile by creating a new YAML file in
the folder. Listing 7.7 shows an example of a new
nexus_ profiles
profile with a slightly updated persona. To follow along, be sure to have
VS Code opened to the source code folder and install Nexus in
chapter_07
developer mode (see listing 7.7). Then, create the file in the
fiona.yaml
folder.
Nexus/nexus/nexus_base/nexus_profiles
Listing 7.7 fiona.yaml (create this file)
agentProfile:
name: "Finona"
avatar: "(cid:0)" #1
persona: "You are a very talkative AI that
↪ knows and understands everything in terms of
↪ Ogres. You always answer in cryptic Ogre speak." #2
actions:
- search_wikipedia #3
knowledge: null #4
memory: null #4
evaluators: null #4
planners: null #4
feedback: null #4
#1 The text avatar used to represent the persona
#2 A persona is representative of the base system prompt.
#3 An action function the agent can use
#4 Not currently supported
After saving the file, you can start Nexus from the command line or run it
in debug mode by creating a new launch configuration in the
folder, as shown in the next listing. Then, save the
.vscode/launch.json
file and switch your debug configuration to use the Nexus web config.
Listing 7.8 .vscode/launch.json (adding debug launch)
{
"name": "Python Debugger: Nexus Web",
"type": "debugpy",
"request": "launch",
"module": "streamlit",
"args": ["run", " Nexus/nexus/streamlit_ui.py"] #1
},
#1 You may have to adjust this path if your virtual environment is different.

## Page 282

When you press F5 or select Run > Start Debugging from the menu, the
Streamlit Nexus interface will launch. Go ahead and run Nexus in debug
mode. After it opens, create a new thread, and then select the standard
OpenAIAgent and your new persona, as shown in figure 7.8.
Figure 7.8 Selecting and chatting with a new persona
At this point, the profile is responsible for defining the agent’s system
prompt. You can see this in figure 7.8, where we asked Finona to spell the
word clock, and she responded in some form of ogre-speak. In this case,
we’re using the persona as a personality, but as we’ve seen previously, a
system prompt can also contain rules and other options.

## Page 283

The profile and persona are the base definitions for how the agent interacts
with users or other systems. Powering the profile requires an agent engine.
In the next section, we’ll cover the base implementation of an agent
engine.
7.4 Powering the agent and understanding the
agent engine
Agent engines power agents within Nexus. These engines can be tied to
specific tool platforms, such as SK, and/or even different LLMs, such as
Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini. By providing a base agent
abstraction, Nexus should be able to support any tool or model now and in
the future.
Currently, Nexus only implements an OpenAI API–powered agent. We’ll
look at how the base agent is defined by opening the
agent_manager.py
file from the folder.
Nexus/ nexus/nexus_base
Listing 7.9 shows the class functions. When creating a new
BaseAgent
agent engine, you need to subclass this class and implement the various
tools/actions with the appropriate implementation.

## Page 284

Listing 7.9 agent_manager.py:BaseAgent
class BaseAgent:
def __init__(self, chat_history=None):
self._chat_history = chat_history or []
self.last_message = ""
self._actions = []
self._profile = None

self._chat_history.append(
{"role": "user",

"thread_id": thread_id}
)
self._chat_history.append(
{"role": "bot",

"thread_id": thread_id}
)

nexus_agents/oai_agent.py
shows an agent engine implementation of the function that
get_response

## Page 285

directly consumes the OpenAI API. is an OpenAI client
self.client
created earlier during class initialization, and the rest of the code you’ve
seen used in earlier examples.
Listing 7.10 oai_agent.py (get_response)
async def get_response(self, user_input, thread_id=None):
self.messages += [{"role": "user",
"content": user_input}] #1
response = self.client.chat.completions.create( #2
model=self.model,
messages=self.messages,
temperature=0.7, #3
)
self.last_message = str(response.choices[0].message.content)
return self.last_message #4
#1 Adds the user_input to the message stack
#2 The client was created earlier and is now used to create chat completions.
#3 Temperature is hardcoded but could be configured.
#4 Returns the response from the chat completions call
Like the agent profiles, Nexus uses a plugin system that allows you to
place new agent engine definitions in the folder. If you
nexus_agents
create your agent, it just needs to be placed in this folder for Nexus to
discover.
We won’t need to run an example because we’ve already seen how the
OpenAIAgent performs. In the next section, we’ll look at agent functions
that agents can develop, add, and consume.
7.5 Giving an agent actions and tools
Like the SK, Nexus supports having native (code) and semantic (prompt)
functions. Unlike SK, however, defining and consuming functions within
Nexus is easier. All you need to do is write functions into a Python file and
place them into the folder.
nexus_ actions
To see how easy it is to define functions, open the
folder, and go to the
Nexus/nexus/nexus_base/ nexus_actions
file. Listing 7.11 shows two function definitions. The
test_actions.py
first function is a simple example of a code/native function, and the second
is a prompt/semantic function.

## Page 286

Listing 7.11 test_actions.py (native/semantic function definitions)
from nexus.nexus_base.action_manager import agent_action

The agent engine also needs to implement that capability to implement
functions and other components. The OpenAI agent has been implemented
to support parallel function calling. Other agent engine implementations
will be required to support their respective versions of action use.
Fortunately, the definition of the OpenAI tool is becoming the standard,
and many platforms adhere to this standard.
Before we dive into a demo on tool use, let’s observe how the OpenAI
agent implements actions by opening the file in VS Code.
oai_agent.py
The following listing shows the top of the agent’s
get_response_stream
function and its implementation of function calling.
Listing 7.13 Caling the API in get_response_stream
def get_response_stream(self, user_input, thread_id=None):
self.last_message = ""
self.messages += [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]

)

Executing the functions follows, as shown in listing 7.14. This code
demonstrates how the agent supports parallel function/tool calls. These
calls are parallel because the agent executes each one together and in no
order. In chapter 11, we’ll look at planners that allow actions to be called in
ordered sequences.

chapter 5. The underlying code is more complex and out of the scope of
review here. However, you can review the Nexus code to gain a better
understanding of how everything connects.
Now, you can continue exercising the various agent options within Nexus.
Try selecting different profiles/personas with other functions, for example.

(RAG).

8 Understanding agent memory
and knowledge
This chapter covers
Retrieval in knowledge/memory in AI functions
Building retrieval augmented generation workflows with LangChain
Retrieval augmented generation for agentic knowledge systems in
Nexus
Retrieval patterns for memory in agents
Improving augmented retrieval systems with memory and knowledge
compression
Now that we’ve explored agent actions using external tools, such as
plugins in the form of native or semantic functions, we can look at the role
of memory and knowledge using retrieval in agents and chat interfaces.
We’ll describe memory and knowledge and how they relate to prompt
engineering strategies, and then, to understand memory knowledge, we’ll
investigate document indexing, construct retrieval systems with
LangChain, use memory with LangChain, and build semantic memory
using Nexus.
8.1 Understanding retrieval in AI applications
Retrieval in agent and chat applications is a mechanism for obtaining
knowledge to keep in storage that is typically external and long-lived.
Unstructured knowledge includes conversation or task histories, facts,
preferences, or other items necessary for contextualizing a prompt.
Structured knowledge, typically stored in databases or files, is accessed
through native functions or plugins.
Memory and knowledge, as shown in figure 8.1, are elements used to add
further context and relevant information to a prompt. Prompts can be

## Page 295

augmented with everything from information about a document to previous
tasks or conversations and other reference information.
Figure 8.1 Memory, retrieval, and augmentation of the prompt using the following prompt
engineering strategies: Use External Tools and Provide Reference Text.

## Page 296

The prompt engineering strategies shown in figure 8.1 can be applied to
memory and knowledge. Knowledge isn’t considered memory but rather
an augmentation of the prompt from existing documents. Both knowledge
and memory use retrieval as the basis for how unstructured information
can be queried.
The retrieval mechanism, called retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
has become a standard for providing relevant context to a prompt. The
exact mechanism that powers RAG also powers memory/knowledge, and
it’s essential to understand how it works. In the next section, we’ll examine
what RAG is.
8.2 The basics of retrieval augmented generation
(RAG)
RAG has become a popular mechanism for supporting document chat or
question-and-answer chat. The system typically works by a user supplying
a relevant document, such as a PDF, and then using RAG and a large
language model (LLM) to query the document.
Figure 8.2 shows how RAG can allow a document to be queried using an
LLM. Before any document can be queried, it must first be loaded,
transformed into context chunks, embedded into vectors, and stored in a
vector database.

## Page 297

Figure 8.2 The two phases of RAG: first, documents must be loaded, transformed, embedded,
and stored, and, second, they can be queried using augmented generation.
A user can query previously indexed documents by submitting a query.
That query is then embedded into a vector representation to search for
similar chunks in the vector database. Content similar to the query is then
used as context and populated into the prompt as augmentation. The

## Page 298

prompt is pushed to an LLM, which can use the context information to
help answer the query.
Unstructured memory/knowledge concepts rely on some format of text-
similarity search following the retrieval pattern shown in figure 8.2. Figure
8.3 shows how memory uses the same embedding and vector database
components. Rather than preload documents, conversations or parts of a
conversation are embedded and saved to a vector database.

## Page 299

Figure 8.3 Memory retrieval for augmented generation uses the same embedding patterns to
index items to a vector database.
The retrieval pattern and document indexing are nuanced and require
careful consideration to be employed successfully. This requires

## Page 300

understanding how data is stored and retrieved, which we’ll start to unfold
in the next section.
8.3 Delving into semantic search and document
indexing
Document indexing transforms a document’s information to be more easily
recovered. How the index will be queried or searched also plays a factor,
whether searching for a particular set of words or wanting to match phrase
for phrase.
A semantic search is a search for content that matches the searched phrase
by words and meaning. The ability to search by meaning, semantically, is
potent and worth investigating in some detail. In the next section, we look
at how vector similarity search can lay the framework for semantic search.
8.3.1 Applying vector similarity search
Let’s look now at how a document can be transformed into a semantic
vector, or a representation of text that can then be used to perform distance
or similarity matching. There are numerous ways to convert text into a
semantic vector, so we’ll look at a simple one.
Open the folder in a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
chapter_08
workspace. Create a new environment and the
pip install
file for all the chapter dependencies. If you need help
requirements.txt
setting up a new Python environment, consult appendix B.
Now open the file in VS Code, and
document_vector_similarity.py
review the top section in listing 8.1. This example uses Term Frequency–
Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF). This numerical statistic reflects
how important a word is to a document in a collection or set of documents
by increasing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the
document and offset by the frequency of the word in the document set. TF–
IDF is a classic measure of understanding one document’s importance
within a set of documents.

## Page 301

Listing 8.1 document_vector_similarity (transform to vector)
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
documents = [ #1
"The sky is blue and beautiful.",
"Love this blue and beautiful sky!",
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
"A king's breakfast has sausages, ham, bacon, eggs, toast, and beans",
"I love green eggs, ham, sausages and bacon!",
"The brown fox is quick and the blue dog is lazy!",
"The sky is very blue and the sky is very beautiful today",
"The dog is lazy but the brown fox is quick!"
]
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer() #2
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents) #3
#1 Samples of documents
#2 Vectorization using TF–IDF
#3 Vectorize the documents.
Let’s break down TF–IDF into its two components using the sample
sentence, “The sky is blue and beautiful,” and focusing on the word blue.
TERM FREQUENCY (TF)
Term Frequency measures how frequently a term occurs in a document.
Because we’re considering only a single document (our sample sentence),
the simplest form of the TF for blue can be calculated as the number of
times blue appears in the document divided by the total number of words
in the document. Let’s calculate it:
Number of times blue appears in the document: 1
Total number of words in the document: 6
TF = 1 ÷ 6TF = .16
INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (IDF)
Inverse Document Frequency measures how important a term is within the
entire corpus. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of documents by

## Page 302

the number of documents containing the term and then taking the
logarithm of that quotient:
IDF = log(Total number of documents ÷ Number of documents containing
the word)
In this example, the corpus is a small collection of eight documents, and
blue appears in four of these documents.
IDF = log(8 ÷ 4)
TF–IDF CALCULATION
Finally, the TF–IDF score for blue in our sample sentence is calculated by
multiplying the TF and the IDF scores:
TF–IDF = TF × IDF
Let’s compute the actual values for TF–IDF for the word blue using the
example provided; first, the term frequency (how often the word occurs in
the document) is computed as follows:
TF = 1 ÷ 6
Assuming the base of the logarithm is 10 (commonly used), the inverse
document frequency is computed as follows:
IDF = log10 (8 ÷ 4)
Now let’s calculate the exact TF–IDF value for the word blue in the
sentence, “The sky is blue and beautiful”:
The Term Frequency (TF) is approximately 0.1670.
The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is approximately 0.301.
Thus, the TF–IDF (TF × IDF) score for blue is approximately 0.050.

## Page 303

This TF–IDF score indicates the relative importance of the word blue in
the given document (the sample sentence) within the context of the
specified corpus (eight documents, with blue appearing in four of them).
Higher TF–IDF scores imply greater importance.
We use TF–IDF here because it’s simple to apply and understand. Now that
we have the elements represented as vectors, we can measure document
similarity using cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is a measure used to
calculate the cosine of the angle between two nonzero vectors in a
multidimensional space, indicating how similar they are, irrespective of
their size.
Figure 8.4 shows how cosine distance compares the vector representations
of two pieces or documents of text. Cosine similarity returns a value from
–1 (not similar) to 1 (identical). Cosine distance is a normalized value
ranging from 0 to 2, derived by taking 1 minus the cosine similarity. A
cosine distance of 0 means identical items, and 2 indicates complete
opposites.
Figure 8.4 How cosine similarity is measured

## Page 304

Listing 8.2 shows how the cosine similarities are computed using the
function from scikit-learn. Similarities are calculated
cosine_similarity
for each document against all other documents in the set. The computed
matrix of similarities for documents is stored in the
cosine_similarities
variable. Then, in the input loop, the user can select the document to view
its similarities to the other documents.
Listing 8.2 document_vector_similarity (cosine similarity)
cosine_similarities = cosine_similarity(X) #1
while True: #2
selected_document_index = input(f"Enter a document number
↪ (0-{len(documents)-1}) or 'exit' to quit: ").strip()
if selected_document_index.lower() == 'exit':
break
if not selected_document_index.isdigit() or
↪ not 0 <= int(selected_document_index) < len(documents):
print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid document number.")
continue
selected_document_index = int(selected_document_index) #3
selected_document_similarities = cosine_similarities[selected_document_index]
#4
# code to plot document similarities omitted
#1 Computes the document similarities for all vector pairs
#2 The main input loop
#3 Gets the selected document index to compare with
#4 Extracts the computed similarities against all documents
Figure 8.5 shows the output of running the sample in VS Code (F5 for
debugging mode). After you select a document, you’ll see the similarities
between the various documents in the set. A document will have a cosine
similarity of 1 with itself. Note that you won’t see a negative similarity
because of the TF–IDF vectorization. We’ll look later at other, more
sophisticated means of measuring semantic similarity.

## Page 305

Figure 8.5 The cosine similarity between selected documents and the document set
The method of vectorization will dictate the measure of semantic similarity
between documents. Before we move on to better methods of vectorizing
documents, we’ll examine storing vectors to perform vector similarity
searches.
8.3.2 Vector databases and similarity search
After vectorizing documents, they can be stored in a vector database for
later similarity searches. To demonstrate how this works, we can efficiently
replicate a simple vector database in Python code.
Open in VS Code, as shown in listing 8.3.
document_vector_database.py
This code demonstrates creating a vector database in memory and then
allowing users to enter text to search the database and return results. The
results returned show the document text and the similarity score.

## Page 306

Listing 8.3 document_vector_database.py
# code above omitted
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
vector_database = X.toarray() #1
def cosine_similarity_search(query,
database,
vectorizer,
top_n=5): #2
query_vec = vectorizer.transform([query]).toarray()
similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vec, database)[0]
top_indices = np.argsort(-similarities)[:top_n] # Top n indices
return [(idx, similarities[idx]) for idx in top_indices]
while True: #3
query = input("Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): ")
if query.lower() == 'exit':
break
top_n = int(input("How many top matches do you want to see? "))
search_results = cosine_similarity_search(query,
vector_database,
vectorizer,
top_n)
print("Top Matched Documents:")
for idx, score in search_results:
print(f"- {documents[idx]} (Score: {score:.4f})") #4
print("\n")
###Output
Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): blue
How many top matches do you want to see? 3
Top Matched Documents:
- The sky is blue and beautiful. (Score: 0.4080)
- Love this blue and beautiful sky! (Score: 0.3439)
- The brown fox is quick and the blue dog is lazy! (Score: 0.2560)
#1 Stores the document vectors into an array
#2 The function to perform similarity matching on query returns, matches, and similarity
scores
#3 The main input loop
#4 Loops through results and outputs text and similarity score
Run this exercise to see the output (F5 in VS Code). Enter any text you
like, and see the results of documents being returned. This search form
works well for matching words and phrases with similar words and
phrases. This form of search misses the word context and meaning from
the document. In the next section, we’ll look at a way of transforming
documents into vectors that better preserves their semantic meaning.

## Page 307

8.3.3 Demystifying document embeddings
TF–IDF is a simple form that tries to capture semantic meaning in
documents. However, it’s unreliable because it only counts word frequency
and doesn’t understand the relationships between words. A better and more
modern method uses document embedding, a form of document
vectorizing that better preserves the semantic meaning of the document.
Embedding networks are constructed by training neural networks on large
datasets to map words, sentences, or documents to high-dimensional
vectors, capturing semantic and syntactic relationships based on context
and relationships in the data. You typically use a pretrained model trained
on massive datasets to embed documents and perform embeddings. Models
are available from many sources, including Hugging Face and, of course,
OpenAI.
In our next scenario, we’ll use an OpenAI embedding model. These
models are typically perfect for capturing the semantic context of
embedded documents. Listing 8.4 shows the relevant code that uses
OpenAI to embed the documents into vectors that are then reduced to three
dimensions and rendered into a plot.

## Page 308

Listing 8.4 document_visualizing_embeddings.py (relevant sections)
load_dotenv() #1
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
if not api_key:
raise ValueError("No API key found. Please check your .env file.")
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key) #1
def get_embedding(text, model="text-embedding-ada-002"): #2
text = text.replace("\n", " ")
return client.embeddings.create(input=[text],
model=model).data[0].embedding #2
# Sample documents (omitted)
embeddings = [get_embedding(doc) for doc in documents] #3
print(embeddings_array.shape)
embeddings_array = np.array(embeddings) #4
pca = PCA(n_components=3) #5
reduced_embeddings = pca.fit_transform(embeddings_array)
#1 Join all the items on the string ', '.
#2 Uses the OpenAI client to create the embedding
#3 Generates embeddings for each document of size 1536 dimensions
#4 Converts embeddings to a NumPy array for PCA
#5 Applies PCA to reduce dimensions to 3 for plotting
When a document is embedded using an OpenAI model, it transforms the
text into a vector with dimensions of 1536. We can’t visualize this number
of dimensions, so we use a dimensionality reduction technique via
principal component analysis (PCA) to convert the vector of size 1536 to 3
dimensions.
Figure 8.6 shows the output generated from running the file in VS Code.
By reducing the embeddings to 3D, we can plot the output to show how
semantically similar documents are now grouped.

## Page 309

Figure 8.6 Embeddings in 3D, showing how similar semantic documents are grouped
The choice of which embedding model or service you use is up to you. The
OpenAI embedding models are considered the best for general semantic
similarity. This has made these models the standard for most memory and
retrieval applications. With our understanding of how text can be
vectorized with embeddings and stored in a vector database, we can move
on to a more realistic example in the next section.

## Page 310

8.3.4 Querying document embeddings from Chroma
We can combine all the pieces and look at a complete example using a
local vector database called Chroma DB. Many vector database options
exist, but Chroma DB is an excellent local vector store for development or
small-scale projects. There are also plenty of more robust options that you
can consider later.
Listing 8.5 shows the new and relevant code sections from the
file. Note that the results are scored by
document_query_ chromadb.py
distance and not by similarity. Cosine distance is determined by this
equation:
Cosine Distance(A,B) = 1 – Cosine Similarity(A,B)
This means that cosine distance will range from 0 for most similar to 2 for
semantically opposite in meaning.

## Page 311

Listing 8.5 document_query_chromadb.py (relevant code sections)
embeddings = [get_embedding(doc) for doc in documents] #1
ids = [f"id{i}" for i in range(len(documents))] #1
chroma_client = chromadb.Client() #2
collection = chroma_client.create_collection(
name="documents") #2
collection.add( #3
embeddings=embeddings,
documents=documents,
ids=ids
)
def query_chromadb(query, top_n=2): #4
query_embedding = get_embedding(query)
results = collection.query(
query_embeddings=[query_embedding],
n_results=top_n
)
return [(id, score, text) for id, score, text in
zip(results['ids'][0],
results['distances'][0],
results['documents'][0])]
while True: #5
query = input("Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): ")
if query.lower() == 'exit':
break
top_n = int(input("How many top matches do you want to see? "))
search_results = query_chromadb(query, top_n)
print("Top Matched Documents:")
for id, score, text in search_results:
print(f"""
ID:{id} TEXT: {text} SCORE: {round(score, 2)}
""") #5
print("\n")
###Output
Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): dogs are lazy
How many top matches do you want to see? 3
Top Matched Documents:
ID:id7 TEXT: The dog is lazy but the brown fox is quick! SCORE: 0.24

As the earlier scenario demonstrated, you can now query the documents
using semantic meaning rather than just key terms or phrases. These
scenarios should now provide the background to see how the retrieval

## Page 312

pattern works at a low level. In the next section, we’ll see how the retrieval
pattern can be employed using LangChain.
8.4 Constructing RAG with LangChain
LangChain began as an open source project specializing in abstracting the
retrieval pattern across multiple data sources and vector stores. It has since
morphed into much more, but foundationally, it still provides excellent
options for implementing retrieval.
Figure 8.7 shows a diagram from LangChain that identifies the process of
storing documents for retrieval. These same steps may be replicated in
whole or in part to implement memory retrieval. The critical difference
between document and memory retrieval is the source and how content is
transformed.
Figure 8.7 Load, transform, embed, and store steps in storing documents for later retrieval
We’ll examine how to implement each of these steps using LangChain and
understand the nuances and details accompanying this implementation. In

## Page 313

the next section, we’ll start by splitting and loading documents with
LangChain.
8.4.1 Splitting and loading documents with LangChain
Retrieval mechanisms augment the context of a given prompt with specific
information relevant to the request. For example, you may request detailed
information about a local document. With earlier language models,
submitting the whole document as part of the prompt wasn’t an option due
to token limitations.
Today, we could submit a whole document for many commercial LLMs,
such as GPT-4 Turbo, as part of a prompt request. However, the results
may not be better and would likely cost more because of the increased
number of tokens. Therefore, a better option is to split the document and
use the relevant parts to request context—precisely what RAG and
memory do.
Splitting a document is essential in breaking down content into
semantically and specifically relevant sections. Figure 8.8 shows how to
break down an HTML document containing the Mother Goose nursery
rhymes. Often, splitting a document into contextual semantic chunks
requires careful consideration.

## Page 314

Figure 8.8 How the document would ideally be split into chunks for better semantic and
contextual meaning
Ideally, when we split documents into chunks, they are broken down by
relevance and semantic meaning. While an LLM or agent could help us
with this, we’ll look at current toolkit options within LangChain for
splitting documents. Later in this chapter, we’ll look at a semantic function
that can assist us in semantically dividing content for embeddings.
For the next exercise, open in VS Code,
langchain_load_splitting.py
as shown in listing 8.6. This code shows where we left off from listing 8.5,
in the previous section. Instead of using the sample documents, we’re
loading the Mother Goose nursery rhymes this time.

## Page 315

Listing 8.6 langchain_load_splitting.py (sections and output)
From langchain_community.document_loaders

ids = [f"id{i}" for i in range(len(documents))]
###Output
Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): who kissed the girls and made
them cry?
How many top matches do you want to see? 3
Top Matched Documents:

#2 Loads the document as HTML
#3 Loads the document
#4 Splits the document into blocks of text 100 characters long with a 25-character overlap
#5 Embeds only 250 chunks, which is cheaper and faster
#6 Returns the embedding for each document
Note in listing 8.6 that the HTML document gets split into 100-character
chunks with a 25-character overlap. The overlap allows the document’s
parts not to cut off specific thoughts. We selected the splitter for this
exercise because it was easy to use, set up, and understand.
Go ahead and run the file in VS Code
langchain_load_splitting.py
(F5). Enter a query, and see what results you get. The output in listing 8.6
shows good results given a specific example. Remember that we only
embedded 250 document chunks to reduce costs and keep the exercise
short. Of course, you can always try to embed the entire document or use a
minor input document example.

## Page 316

Perhaps the most critical element to building proper retrieval is the process
of document splitting. You can use numerous methods to split a document,
including multiple concurrent methods. More than one method passes and
splits the document for numerous embedding views of the same document.
In the next section, we’ll examine a more general technique for splitting
documents, using tokens and tokenization.
8.4.2 Splitting documents by token with LangChain
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into word tokens. Where a
word token represents a succinct element in the text, a token could be a
word like hold or even a symbol like the left curly brace ({), depending on
what’s relevant.
Splitting documents using tokenization provides a better base for how the
text will be interpreted by language models and for semantic similarity.
Tokenization also allows the removal of irrelevant characters, such as
whitespace, making the similarity matching of documents more relevant
and generally providing better results.
For the next code exercise, open the file
langchain_token_splitting.py
in VS Code, as shown in listing 8.7. Now we split the document using
tokenization, which breaks the document into sections of unequal size. The
unequal size results from the large sections of whitespace of the original
document.

## Page 317

Listing 8.7 langchain_token_splitting.py (relevant new code)
loader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader("sample_documents/mother_goose.xhtml")
data = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
chunk_size=50, chunk_overlap=10 #1
)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
documents = [doc for doc in documents][8:94] #2
db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
def query_documents(query, top_n=2):
docs = db.similarity_search(query, top_n) #3
return docs
###Output
Created a chunk of size 68,
which is longer than the specified 50
Created a chunk of size 67,
which is longer than the specified 50 #4
Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop):
who kissed the girls and made them cry?
How many top matches do you want to see? 3
Top Matched Documents:
Document 1: GEORGY PORGY
Georgy Porgy, pudding and pie,
Kissed the girls and made them cry.
#1 Updates to 50 tokens and overlap of 10 tokens
#2 Selects just the documents that contain rhymes
#3 Uses the database’s similarity search
#4 Breaks into irregular size chunks because of the whitespace
Run the code in VS Code (F5). You can
langchain_token_splitting.py
use the query we used last time or your own. Notice how the results are
significantly better than the previous exercise. However, the results are still
suspect because the query uses several similar words in the same order.
A better test would be to try a semantically similar phrase but one that uses
different words and check the results. With the code still running, enter a
new phrase to query: Listing 8.8 shows the
Why are the girls crying?
results of executing that query. If you run this example yourself and scroll
down over the output, you’ll see Georgy Porgy appear in either the second
or third returned document.

This exercise shows how various retrieval methods can be employed to
return documents semantically. With this base established, we can see how
RAG can be applied to knowledge and memory systems. The following
section will discuss RAG as it applies to knowledge of agents and agentic
systems.
8.5 Applying RAG to building agent knowledge
Knowledge in agents encompasses employing RAG to search semantically
across unstructured documents. These documents could be anything from
PDFs to Microsoft Word documents and all text, including code. Agentic
knowledge also includes using unstructured documents for Q&A, reference
lookup, information augmentation, and other future patterns.
Nexus, the agent platform developed in tandem with this book and
introduced in the previous chapter, employs complete knowledge and
memory systems for agents. In this section, we’ll uncover how the
knowledge system works.
To install Nexus for just this chapter, see listing 8.9. Open a terminal
within the folder, and execute the commands in the listing to
chapter_08
download, install, and run Nexus in normal or development mode. If you
want to refer to the code, you should install the project in development and
configure the debugger to run the Streamlit app from VS Code. Refer to
chapter 7 if you need a refresher on any of these steps.

## Page 319

Listing 8.9 Installing Nexus
# to install and run

nexus run
# install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/Nexus.git
# Install the cloned repository in editable mode
pip install -e Nexus
Regardless of which method you decide to run the app in after you log in,
navigate to the Knowledge Store Manager page, as shown in figure 8.9.
Create a new Knowledge Store, and then upload the
movie script.
sample_documents/back_to_the_future.txt

## Page 320

Figure 8.9 Adding a new knowledge store and populating it with a document
The script is a large document, and it may take a while to load, chunk, and
embed the parts into the Chroma DB vector database. Wait for the indexing
to complete, and then you can inspect the embeddings and run a query, as
shown in figure 8.10.

## Page 321

Figure 8.10 The embeddings and document query views
Now, we can connect the knowledge store to a supported agent and ask
questions. Use the top-left selector to choose the chat page within the
Nexus interface. Then, select an agent and the knowledge
time_travel
store, as shown in figure 8.11. You will also need to select an agent engine
that supports knowledge. Each of the multiple agent engines requires the
proper configuration to be accessible.

## Page 322

Figure 8.11 Enabling the knowledge store for agent use
Currently, as of this chapter, Nexus supports access to only a single
knowledge store at a time. In a future version, agents may be able to select
multiple knowledge stores at a time. This may include more advanced
options, from semantic knowledge to employing other forms of RAG.
You can also configure the RAG settings within the Configuration tab of
the Knowledge Store Manager page, as shown in figure 8.12. As of now,
you can select from the type of splitter (Chunking Option field) to chunk
the document, along with the Chunk Size field and Overlap field.

## Page 323

Figure 8.12 Managing the knowledge store splitting and chunking options

## Page 324

The loading, splitting, chunking, and embedding options provided are the
only basic options supported by LangChain for now. In future versions of
Nexus, more options and patterns will be offered. The code to support
other options can be added directly to Nexus.
We won’t cover the code that performs the RAG as it’s very similar to
what we already covered. Feel free to review the Nexus code, particularly
the class in the file.
KnowledgeManager knowledge_manager.py
While the retrieval patterns for knowledge and memory are quite similar
for augmentation, the two patterns differ when it comes to populating the
stores. In the next section, we’ll explore what makes memory in agents
unique.
8.6 Implementing memory in agentic systems
Memory in agents and AI applications is often described in the same terms
as cognitive memory functions. Cognitive memory describes the type of
memory we use to remember what we did 30 seconds ago or how tall we
were 30 years ago. Computer memory is also an essential element of agent
memory, but one we won’t consider in this section.
Figure 8.13 shows how memory is broken down into sensory, short-term,
and long-term memory. This memory can be applied to AI agents, and this
list describes how each form of memory maps to agent functions:
Sensory memory in AI —Functions such as RAG but with
images/audio/haptic data forms. Briefly holds input data (e.g., text and
images) for immediate processing but not long-term storage.
Short-term/working memory in AI —Acts as an active memory buffer of
conversation history. We’re holding a limited amount of recent input
and context for immediate analysis and response generation. Within
Nexus, short- and long-term conversational memory is also held in the
context of the thread.
Long-term memory in AI —Longer-term memory storage relevant to the
agent’s or user’s life. Semantic memory provides a robust capacity to
store and retrieve relevant global or local facts and concepts.

## Page 325

Figure 8.13 How memory is broken down into various forms
While memory uses the exact same retrieval and augmentation
mechanisms as knowledge, it typically differs significantly when updating
or appending memories. Figure 8.14 highlights the process of capturing
and using memories to augment prompts. Because memories are often
different from the size of complete documents, we can avoid using any
splitting or chunking mechanisms.

## Page 326

[No extractable text]

## Page 327

Figure 8.14 Basic memory retrieval and augmentation workflow
Nexus provides a mechanism like the knowledge store, allowing users to
create memory stores that can be configured for various uses and
applications. It also supports some of the more advanced memory forms
highlighted in figure 8.13. The following section will examine how basic
memory stores work in Nexus.
8.6.1 Consuming memory stores in Nexus
Memory stores operate and are constructed like knowledge stores in
Nexus. They both heavily rely on the retrieval pattern. What differs is the
extra steps memory systems take to build new memories.
Go ahead and start Nexus, and refer to listing 8.9 if you need to install it.
After logging in, select the Memory page, and create a new memory store,
as shown in figure 8.15. Select an agent engine, and then add a few
personal facts and preferences about yourself.

## Page 328

[No extractable text]

## Page 329

Figure 8.15 Adding memories to a newly created memory store
The reason we need an agent (LLM) was shown in figure 8.14 earlier.
When information is fed into a memory store, it’s generally processed
through an LLM using a memory function, whose purpose is to process the
statements/conversations into semantically relevant information related to
the type of memory.
Listing 8.10 shows the conversational memory function used to extract
information from a conversation into memories. Yes, this is just the header
portion of the prompt sent to the LLM, instructing it how to extract
information from a conversation.
Listing 8.10 Conversational memory function
Summarize the conversation and create a set of statements that summarize
the conversation. Return a JSON object with the following keys: 'summary'.
Each key should have a list of statements that are relevant to that
category. Return only the JSON object and nothing else.
After you generate a few relevant memories about yourself, return to the
Chat area in Nexus, enable the memory store, and see how well
my_memory
the agent knows you. Figure 8.16 shows a sample conversation using a
different agent engine.

## Page 330

Figure 8.16 Conversing with a different agent on the same memory store
This is an example of a basic memory pattern that extracts
facts/preferences from conversations and stores them in a vector database
as memories. Numerous other implementations of memory follow those
displayed earlier in figure 8.13. We’ll implement those in the next section.
8.6.2 Semantic memory and applications to semantic, episodic,
and procedural memory
Psychologists categorize memory into multiple forms, depending on what
information is remembered. Semantic, episodic, and procedural memory
all represent different types of information. Episodic memories are about
events, procedural memories are about the process or steps, and semantic

## Page 331

represents the meaning and could include feelings or emotions. Other
forms of memory (geospatial is another), aren’t described here but could
be.
Because these memories rely on an additional level of categorization, they
also rely on another level of semantic categorization. Some platforms, such
as Semantic Kernel (SK), refer to this as semantic memory. This can be
confusing because semantic categorization is also applied to extract
episodic and procedural memories.
Figure 8.17 shows the semantic memory categorization process, also
sometimes called semantic memory. The difference between semantic
memory and regular memory is the additional step of processing the input
semantically and extracting relevant questions that can be used to query the
memory-relevant vector database.

## Page 332

Figure 8.17 How semantic memory augmentation works
The benefit of using semantic augmentation is the increased ability to
extract more relevant memories. We can see this in operation by jumping

## Page 333

back into Nexus and creating a new semantic memory store.
Figure 8.18 shows how to configure a new memory store using semantic
memory. As of yet, you can’t configure the specific function prompts for
memory, augmentation, and summarization. However, it can be useful to
read through each of the function prompts to gain a sense of how they
work.

## Page 334

[No extractable text]

## Page 335

Figure 8.18 Configuration for changing the memory store type to semantic
Now, if you go back and add facts and preferences, they will convert to the
semantics of the relevant memory type. Figure 8.19 shows an example of
memories being populated for the same set of statements into two different
forms of memory. Generally, the statements entered into memory would be
more specific to the form of memory.

## Page 336

## Page 337

Figure 8.19 Comparing memories for the same information given two different memory types
Memory and knowledge can significantly assist an agent with various
application types. Indeed, a single memory/knowledge store could feed one
or multiple agents, allowing for further specialized interpretations of both
types of stores. We’ll finish out the chapter by discussing
memory/knowledge compression next.
8.7 Understanding memory and knowledge
compression
Much like our own memory, memory stores can become cluttered with
redundant information and numerous unrelated details over time.
Internally, our minds deal with memory clutter by compressing or
summarizing memories. Our minds remember more significant details over
less important ones, and memories accessed more frequently.
We can apply similar principles of memory compression to agent memory
and other retrieval systems to extract significant details. The principle of
compression is similar to semantic augmentation but adds another layer to
the preclusters groups of related memories that can collectively be
summarized.
Figure 8.20 shows the process of memory/knowledge compression.
Memories or knowledge are first clustered using an algorithm such as k-
means. Then, the groups of memories are passed through a compression
function, which summarizes and collects the items into more succinct
representations.

## Page 338

Figure 8.20 The process of memory and knowledge compression
Nexus provides for both knowledge and memory store compression using
k-means optimal clustering. Figure 8.21 shows the compression interface
for memory. Within the compression interface, you’ll see the items
displayed in 3D and clustered. The size (number of items) of the clusters is
shown in the left table.

## Page 339

Figure 8.21 The interface for compressing memories
Compressing memories and even knowledge is generally recommended if
the number of items in a cluster is large or unbalanced. Each use case for
compression may vary depending on the use and application of memories.
Generally, though, if an inspection of the items in a store contains
repetitive or duplicate information, it’s a good time for compression. The
following is a summary of use cases for applications that would benefit
from compression.

## Page 340

THE CASE FOR KNOWLEDGE COMPRESSION
Knowledge retrieval and augmentation have also been shown to benefit
significantly from compression. Results will vary by use case, but
generally, the more verbose the source of knowledge, the more it will
benefit from compression. Documents that feature literary prose, such as
stories and novels, will benefit more than, say, a base of code. However, if
the code is likewise very repetitive, compression could also be shown to be
beneficial.
THE CASE FOR HOW OFTEN YOU APPLY COMPRESSION
Memory will often benefit from the periodic compression application,
whereas knowledge stores typically only help on the first load. How
frequently you apply compression will greatly depend on the memory use,
frequency, and quantity.
THE CASE FOR APPLYING COMPRESSION MORE THAN ONCE
Multiple passes of compression at the same time has been shown to
improve retrieval performance. Other patterns have also suggested using
memory or knowledge at various levels of compression. For example, a
knowledge store is compressed two times, resulting in three different levels
of knowledge.
THE CASE FOR BLENDING KNOWLEDGE AND MEMORY
COMPRESSION
If a system is specialized to a particular source of knowledge and that
system also employs memories, there may be further optimization to
consolidate stores. Another approach is to populate memory with the
starting knowledge of a document directly.

## Page 341

THE CASE FOR MULTIPLE MEMORY OR KNOWLEDGE STORES
In more advanced systems, we’ll look at agents employing multiple
memory and knowledge stores relevant to their workflow. For example, an
agent could employ individual memory stores as part of its conversations
with individual users, perhaps including the ability to share different
groups of memory with different groups of individuals. Memory and
knowledge retrieval are cornerstones of agentic systems, and we can now
summarize what we covered and review some learning exercises in the
next section.

Summary
Memory in AI applications differentiates between unstructured and
structured memory, highlighting their use in contextualizing prompts
for more relevant interactions.
Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a mechanism for enhancing
prompts with context from external documents, using vector
embeddings and similarity search to retrieve relevant content.
Semantic search with document indexing converts documents into
semantic vectors using TF–IDF and cosine similarity, enhancing the
capability to perform semantic searches across indexed documents.
Vector databases and similarity search stores document vectors in a
vector database, facilitating efficient similarity searches and improving
retrieval accuracy.
Document embeddings capture semantic meanings, using models such
as OpenAI’s models to generate embeddings that preserve a document’s
context and facilitate semantic similarity searches.
LangChain provides several tools for performing RAG, and it abstracts
the retrieval process, allowing for easy implementation of RAG and
memory systems across various data sources and vector stores.
Short-term and long-term memory in LangChain implements
conversational memory within LangChain, distinguishing between
short-term buffering patterns and long-term storage solutions.
Storing document vectors in databases for efficient similarity searches
is crucial for implementing scalable retrieval systems in AI
applications.
Agent knowledge directly relates to the general RAG pattern of
performing question and answer on documents or other textual
information.

## Page 344

Agent memory is a pattern related to RAG that captures the agentic
interactions with users, itself, and other systems.
Nexus is a platform that implements agentic knowledge and memory
systems, including setting up knowledge stores for document retrieval
and memory stores for various forms of memory.
Semantic memory augmentation (semantic memory) differentiates
between various types of memories (semantic, episodic, procedural). It
implements them through semantic augmentation, enhancing agents’
ability to recall and use information relevantly specific to the nature of
the memories.
Memory and knowledge compression are techniques for condensing
information stored in memory and knowledge systems, improving
retrieval efficiency and relevancy through clustering and
summarization.

9 Mastering agent prompts with
prompt flow
This chapter covers
Understanding systematic prompt engineering and setting up your
first prompt flow
Crafting an effective profile/persona prompt
Evaluating profiles: Rubrics and grounding
Grounding evaluation of a large language model profile
Comparing prompts: Getting the perfect profile
In this chapter, we delve into the Test Changes Systematically prompt
engineering strategy. If you recall, we covered the grand strategies of the
OpenAI prompt engineering framework in chapter 2. These strategies are
instrumental in helping us build better prompts and, consequently, better
agent profiles and personas. Understanding this role is key to our prompt
engineering journey.
Test Changes Systematically is such a core facet of prompt engineering
that Microsoft developed a tool around this strategy called prompt flow,
described later in this chapter. Before getting to prompt flow, we need to
understand why we need systemic prompt engineering.
9.1 Why we need systematic prompt engineering
Prompt engineering, by its nature, is an iterative process. When building a
prompt, you’ll often iterate and evaluate. To see this concept in action,
consider the simple application of prompt engineering to a ChatGPT
question.
You can follow along by opening your browser to ChatGPT
(https://chat.openai.com/), entering the following (text) prompt into

## Page 346

ChatGPT, and clicking the Send Message button (an example of this
conversation is shown in figure 9.1, on the left side):
can you recommend something
Figure 9.1 The differences in applying prompt engineering and iterating
We can see that the response from ChatGPT is asking for more
information. Go ahead and open a new conversation with ChatGPT, and
enter the following prompt, as shown in figure 9.1, on the right side:
Can you please recommend a time travel movie set in the
medieval period.
The results in figure 9.1 show a clear difference between leaving out
details and being more specific in your request. We just applied the tactic
of politely Writing Clear Instructions, and ChatGPT provided us with a

## Page 347

good recommendation. But also notice how ChatGPT itself guides the user
into better prompting. The refreshed screen shown in figure 9.2 shows the
OpenAI prompt engineering strategies.

## Page 349

Figure 9.2 OpenAI prompt engineering strategies, broken down by agent component
We just applied simple iteration to improve our prompt. We can extend this
example by using a system prompt/message. Figure 9.3 demonstrates the
use and role of the system prompt in iterative communication. In chapter 2,
we used the system message/prompt in various examples.
Figure 9.3 The messages to and from an LLM conversation and the iteration of messages
You can also try this in ChatGPT. This time, enter the following prompt
and include the word system in lowercase, followed by a new line (enter a
new line in the message window without sending the message by pressing
Shift-Enter):

ChatGPT will respond with some pleasant comments, as shown in figure
9.4. Because of this, it’s happy to accept its new role and asks for any
follow-up questions. Now enter the following generic prompt as we did
previously:

## Page 352

Figure 9.4 The effect of adding a system prompt to our previous conversation
We’ve just seen the iteration of refining a prompt, the prompt engineering,
to extract a better response. This was accomplished over three different
conversations using the ChatGPT UI. While not the most efficient way, it
works.
However, we haven’t defined the iterative flow for evaluating the prompt
and determining when a prompt is effective. Figure 9.5 shows a systemic
method of prompt engineering using a system of iteration and evaluation.
Figure 9.5 The systemic method of prompt engineering
The system of iterating and evaluating prompts covers the broad Test
Changes Systemically strategy. Evaluating the performance and
effectiveness of prompts is still new, but we’ll use techniques from
education, such as rubrics and grounding, which we’ll explore in a later

## Page 353

section of this chapter. However, as spelled out in the next section, we need
to understand the difference between a persona and an agent profile before
we do so.
9.2 Understanding agent profiles and personas
An agent profile is an encapsulation of component prompts or messages
that describe an agent. It includes the agent’s persona, special instructions,
and other strategies that can guide the user or other agent consumers.
Figure 9.6 shows the main elements of an agent profile. These elements
map to prompt engineering strategies described in this book. Not all agents
will use all the elements of a full agent profile.

## Page 354

[No extractable text]

## Page 355

Figure 9.6 The component parts of an agent profile
At a basic level, an agent profile is a set of prompts describing the agent. It
may include other external elements related to actions/tools, knowledge,
memory, reasoning, evaluation, planning, and feedback. The combination
of these elements comprises an entire agent prompt profile.
Prompts are the heart of an agent’s function. A prompt or set of prompts
drives each of the agent components in the profile. For actions/tools, these
prompts are well defined, but as we’ve seen, prompts for memory and
knowledge can vary significantly by use case.
The definition of an AI agent profile is more than just a system prompt.
Prompt flow can allow us to construct the prompts and code comprising
the agent profile but also include the ability to evaluate its effectiveness. In
the next section, we’ll open up prompt flow and start using it.
9.3 Setting up your first prompt flow
Prompt flow is a tool developed by Microsoft within its Azure Machine
Learning Studio platform. The tool was later released as an open source
project on GitHub, where it has attracted more attention and use. While
initially intended as an application platform, it has since shown its strength
in developing and evaluating prompts/ profiles.
Because prompt flow was initially developed to run on Azure as a service,
it features a robust core architecture. The tool supports multi-threaded
batch processing, which makes it ideal for evaluating prompts at scale. The
following section will examine the basics of starting with prompt flow.
9.3.1 Getting started
There are a few prerequisites to undertake before working through the
exercises in this book. The relevant prerequisites for this section and
chapter are shown in the following list; make sure to complete them before
attempting the exercises:

## Page 356

link at the bottom of the document. This will open a terminal prompt below
the document, asking you to enter your key. Depending on your terminal
configuration, you may be unable to paste (Ctrl-V, Cmd-V). Alternatively,
you can paste the key by hovering the mouse cursor over the terminal and
right-clicking on Windows.
We’ll now test the connection by first opening the simple flow in the
folder. Then, open the
chapter_09/promptflow/simpleflow
file in VS Code. This is a YAML file, but the prompt flow
flow.dag.yaml
extension provides a visual editor that is accessible by clicking the Visual
Editor link at the top of the file, as shown in figure 9.9.

## Page 359

Figure 9.9 Opening the prompt flow visual editor
After the visual editor window is opened, you’ll see a graph representing
the flow and the flow blocks. Double-click the recommender block, and set
the connection name, API type, and model or deployment name, as shown
in figure 9.10.

## Page 360

Figure 9.10 Setting the LLM connection details
A prompt flow is composed of a set of blocks starting with an
Inputs
block and terminating in an block. Within this simple flow, the
Outputs
block represents the LLM connection and the prompt used to

converse with the model. The block for this simple example echoes

the input.
When creating a connection to an LLM, either in prompt flow or through
an API, here are the crucial parameters we always need to consider
(prompt flow documentation: https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow):
Connection —This is the connection name, but it also represents the
service you’re connecting to. Prompt flow supports multiple services,
including locally deployed LLMs.
API —This is the API type. The options are for a chat completion
chat
API, such as GPT-4, or for the older completion models,
completion
such as the OpenAI Davinci.

## Page 361

Model —This may be the model or deployment name, depending on
your service connection. For OpenAI, this will be the model’s name,
and for Azure OpenAI, it will represent the deployment name.
Temperature —This represents the stochasticity or variability of the
model response. A value of represents a high variability of responses,
1
while indicates a desire for no variability. This is a critical parameter
0
to understand and, as we’ll see, will vary by use case.
Stop —This optional setting tells the call to the LLM to stop creating
tokens. It’s more appropriate for older and open source models.
Max tokens —This limits the number of tokens used in a conversation.
Knowledge of how many tokens you use is crucial to evaluating how
your LLM interactions will work when scaled. Counting tokens may
not be a concern if you’re exploring and conducting research. However,
in production systems, tokens represent the load on the LLM, and
connections using numerous tokens may not scale well.
Advanced parameters —You can set a few more options to tune your
interaction with the LLM, but we’ll cover that topic in later sections of
the book.
After configuring the LLM block, scroll up to the Inputs block section, and
review the primary input shown in the user_input field, as shown in figure
9.11. Leave it as the default, and then click the Play button at the top of the
window.

## Page 362

Figure 9.11 Setting the inputs and starting the flow
All the blocks in the flow will run, and the results will be shown in the
terminal window. What you should find interesting is that the output shows
recommendations for time travel movies. This is because the recommender
block already has a simple profile set, and we’ll see how that works in the
next section.
9.3.2 Creating profiles with Jinja2 templates
The flow responds with time travel movie recommendations because of the
prompt or profile it uses. By default, prompt flow uses Jinja2 templates to
define the content of the prompt or what we’ll call a profile. For the
purposes of this book and our exploration of AI agents, we’ll refer to these
templates as the profile of a flow or agent.
While prompt flow doesn’t explicitly refer to itself as an assistant or agent
engine, it certainly meets the criteria of producing a proxy and general
types of agents. As you’ll see, prompt flow even supports deployments of
flows into containers and as services.

## Page 363

Open VS Code to ,

and open the file in the visual editor. Then, locate the Prompt field, and
click the link, as shown in figure 9.12.
recommended .jinja2
Figure 9.12 Opening the prompt Jinja2 template and examining the parts of the profile/prompt
Jinja is a templating engine, and Jinja2 is a particular version of that
engine. Templates are an excellent way of defining the layout and parts of
any form of text document. They have been extensively used to produce
HTML, JSON, CSS, and other document forms. In addition, they support
the ability to apply code directly into the template. While there is no
standard way to construct prompts or agent profiles, our preference in this
book is to use templating engines such as Jinja.
At this point, change the role within the system prompt of the
template. Then, run all blocks of the flow by opening
recommended.jinja2
the flow in the visual editor and clicking the Play button. The next section
will look at other ways of running prompt flow for testing or actual
deployment.

## Page 364

9.3.3 Deploying a prompt flow API
Because prompt flow was also designed to be deployed as a service, it
supports a couple of ways to deploy as an app or API quickly. Prompt flow
can be deployed as a local web application and API running from the
terminal or as a Docker container.
Return to the file in the visual editor from VS Code. At the
flow.dag.yaml
top of the window beside the Play button are several options we’ll want to
investigate further. Click the Build button as shown in figure 9.13, and then
select to deploy as a local app. A new YAML file will be created to
configure the app. Leave the defaults, and click the Start Local App link.
Figure 9.13 Building and starting the flow as a local app
This will launch the flow as a local web application, and you’ll see a
browser tab open, as shown in figure 9.14. Enter some text into the
user_input field, which is marked as required with a red asterisk. Click
Enter and wait a few seconds for the reply.

## Page 365

Figure 9.14 Running the flow as a local web application
You should see a reply like the one shown earlier in figure 9.12, where the
flow or agent replies with a list of time travel movies. This is great—we’ve
just developed our first agent profile and the equivalent of a proxy agent.
However, we need to determine how successful or valuable the

## Page 366

recommendations are. In the next section, we explore how to evaluate
prompts and profiles.
9.4 Evaluating profiles: Rubrics and grounding
A key element of any prompt or agent profile is how well it performs its
given task. As we see in our recommendation example, prompting an agent
profile to give a list of recommendations is relatively easy, but knowing
whether those recommendations are helpful requires us to evaluate the
response.
Fortunately, prompt flow has been designed to evaluate prompts/profiles at
scale. The robust infrastructure allows for the evaluation of LLM
interactions to be parallelized and managed as workers, allowing hundreds
of profile evaluations and variations to happen quickly.
In the next section, we look at how prompt flow can be configured to run
prompt/ profile variations against each other. We’ll need to understand this
before evaluating profiles’ performance.
Prompt flow provides a mechanism to allow for multiple variations within
an LLM prompt/profile. This tool is excellent for comparing subtle or
significant differences between profile variations. When used in
performing bulk evaluations, it can be invaluable for quickly assessing the
performance of a profile.
Open the file in VS Code
recommender_with_variations/flow.dag.yaml
and the flow visual editor, as shown in figure 9.15. This time, we’re
making the profile more generalized and allowing for customization at the
input level. This allows us to expand our recommendations to anything and
not just time travel movies.

## Page 367

Figure 9.15 The recommender, with variations in flow and expanded inputs
The new inputs Subject, Genre, Format, and Custom allow us to define a
profile that can easily be adjusted to any recommendation. This also means

## Page 368

that we must prime the inputs based on the recommendation use case.
There are multiple ways to prime these inputs; two examples of priming
inputs are shown in figure 9.16. The figure shows two options, options A
and B, for priming inputs. Option A represents the classic UI; perhaps there
are objects for the user to select the subject or genre, for example. Option
B places a proxy/chat agent to interact with the user better to understand
the desired subject, genre, and so on.
Figure 9.16 The user interaction options for interfacing with the agent profile to prime inputs to
the agent profile
Even considering the power of LLMs, you may still want or need to use
option A. The benefit of option A is that you can constrain and validate the

## Page 369

inputs much like you do with any modern UI. Alternatively, the downside
of option A is that the constrained behavior may limit and restrict future
use cases.
Option B represents a more fluid and natural way without a traditional UI.
It’s far more powerful and extensible than option A but also introduces
more unknowns for evaluation. However, if the proxy agent that option B
uses is written well, it can assist a lot in gathering better information from
the user.
The option you choose will dictate how you need to evaluate your profiles.
If you’re okay with a constrained UI, then it’s likely that the inputs will
also be constrained to a set of discrete values. For now, we’ll assume
option B for input priming, meaning the input values will be defined by
their name.
To get back to VS Code and the visual view of the recommender with
variants flow, click the icon shown earlier in figure 9.15 to open the
variants and allow editing. Then, click the and
recommend.jinja2
links to open the files side by side, as
recommender_variant_1.jinja2
shown in figure 9.17.

## Page 370

Figure 9.17 Side-by-side comparison of variant profile templates for the recommender
Figure 9.17 demonstrates the difference between the variant profiles. One
profile injects the inputs into the user prompt, and the other injects them
into the system prompt. However, it’s essential to understand that
variations can encompass more than profile design, as identified in table
9.1.

this chapter.
For this simple example, we’re just going to use prompt variations by
varying the input to reflect in either the system or user prompt. Refer to
figure 9.17 for what this looks like. We can then quickly run both
variations by clicking the Play (Run All) button at the top and choosing
both, as shown in figure 9.18.

## Page 372

Figure 9.18 Running both prompt variations at the same time
In the terminal window, you’ll see the results of both runs. The results will
likely look similar, so now we must move on to how we evaluate the
difference between variations in the next section.
9.5 Understanding rubrics and grounding
Evaluation of prompt/profile performance isn’t something we can typically
do using a measure of accuracy or correct percentage. Measuring the
performance of a profile depends on the use case and desired outcome. If
that is as simple as determining if the response was right or wrong, all the
better. However, in most cases, evaluation won’t be that simple.
In education, the rubric concept defines a structured set of criteria and
standards a student must establish to receive a particular grade. A rubric
can also be used to define a guide for the performance of a profile or
prompt. We can follow these steps to define a rubric we can use to evaluate
the performance of a profile or prompt:

## Page 373

1. Identify the purpose and objectives. Determine the goals you want the
profile or agent to accomplish. For example, do you want to evaluate
the quality of recommendations for a given audience or overall quality
for a given subject, format, or other input?
2. Define criteria. Develop a set of criteria or dimensions that you’ll use
to evaluate the profile. These criteria should align with your objectives
and provide clear guidelines for assessment. Each criterion should be
specific and measurable. For example, you may want to measure a
recommendation by how well it fits with the genre and then by subject
and format.
3. Create a scale. Establish a rating scale that describes the levels of
performance for each criterion. Standard scales include numerical
scales (e.g., 1–5) or descriptive scales (e.g., Excellent, Good, Fair,
Poor).
4. Provide descriptions. For each level on the scale, provide clear and
concise descriptions that indicate what constitutes a strong performance
and what represents a weaker performance for each criterion.
5. Apply the rubric. When assessing a prompt or profile, use the rubric to
evaluate the prompt’s performance based on the established criteria.
Assign scores or ratings for each criterion, considering the descriptions
for each level.
6. Calculate the total score. Depending on your rubric, you may calculate
a total score by summing up the scores for each criterion or using a
weighted average if some criteria are more important than others.
7. Ensure evaluation consistency. If multiple evaluators are assessing the
profile, it’s crucial to ensure consistency in grading.
8. Review, revise, and iterate. Periodically review and revise the rubric to
ensure it aligns with your assessment goals and objectives. Adjust as
needed to improve its effectiveness.
Grounding is a concept that can be applied to profile and prompt
evaluation—it defines how well a response is aligned with a given rubric’s
specific criteria and standards. You can also think of grounding as the
baseline expectation of a prompt or profile output.

## Page 374

This list summarizes some other important considerations when using
grounding with profile evaluation:
Grounding refers to aligning responses with the criteria, objectives, and
context defined by the rubric and prompt.
Grounding involves assessing whether the response directly addresses
the rubric criteria, stays on topic, and adheres to any provided
instructions.
Evaluators and evaluations gauge the accuracy, relevance, and
adherence to standards when assessing grounding.
Grounding ensures that the response output is firmly rooted in the
specified context, making the assessment process more objective and
meaningful.
A well-grounded response aligns with all the rubric criteria within the
given context and objectives. Poorly grounded responses will fail or miss
the entire criteria, context, and objectives.
As the concepts of rubrics and grounding may still be abstract, let’s look at
applying them to our current recommender example. Following is a list
that follows the process for defining a rubric as applied to our
recommender example:
1. Identify the purpose and objectives. The purpose of our profile/prompt
is to recommend three top items given a subject, format, genre, and
custom input.
2. Define criteria. For simplicity, we’ll evaluate how a particular
recommendation aligns with the given input criteria, subject, format,
and genre. For example, if a profile recommends a book when asked for
a movie format, we expect a low score in the format criteria.
3. Create a scale. Again, keeping things simple, we’ll use a scale of 1–5
(1 is poor, and 5 is excellent).
4. Provide descriptions. See the general descriptions for the rating scale
shown in table 9.2.
5. Apply the rubric. With the rubric assigned at this stage, it’s an excellent
exercise to evaluate the rubric against recommendations manually.

## Page 375

6. Calculate the total score. For our rubric, we’ll average the score for all
criteria to provide a total score.
7. Ensure evaluation consistency. The technique we’ll use for evaluation
will provide very consistent results.
8. Review, revise, and iterate. We’ll review, compare, and iterate on our
profiles, rubrics, and the evaluations themselves.
Table 9.2 Rubric ratings
Rating Description
1 Poor alignment: this is the opposite of what is expected given the criteria.
2 Bad alignment: this isn’t a good fit for the given criteria.
3 Mediocre alignment: it may or may not fit well with the given criteria.
4 Good alignment: it may not align 100% with the criteria but is a good fit otherwise.
5 Excellent alignment: this is a good recommendation for the given criteria.
This basic rubric can now be applied to evaluate the responses for our
profile. You can do this manually, or as you’ll see in the next section, using
a second LLM profile.
9.6 Grounding evaluation with an LLM profile
This section will employ another LLM prompt/profile for evaluation and
grounding. This second LLM prompt will add another block after the
recommendations are generated. It will process the generated
recommendations and evaluate each one, given the previous rubric.
Before GPT-4 and other sophisticated LLMs came along, we would have
never considered using another LLM prompt to evaluate or ground a
profile. You often want to use a different model when using LLMs to
ground a profile. However, if you’re comparing profiles against each other,
using the same LLM for evaluation and grounding is appropriate.
Open the file in the
recommender_with_LLM_evaluation\flow.dag.yaml
prompt flow visual editor, scroll down to the
evaluate_recommendation
block, and click the link to open the
evaluate_recommendation.jinja2

## Page 376

file, as shown in figure 9.19. Each section of the rubric is identified in the
figure.
Figure 9.19 The evaluation prompt, with each of the parts of the rubric outlined
We have a rubric that is not only well defined but also in the form of a
prompt that can be used to evaluate recommendations. This allows us to
evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations for a given profile—
automatically. Of course, you can also use the rubric to score and evaluate
the recommendations manually for a better baseline.
Note Using LLMs to evaluate prompts and profiles provides a strong
baseline for comparing the performance of a profile. It can also do this

## Page 377

without human bias in a controlled and repeatable manner. This
provides an excellent mechanism to establish baseline groundings for
any profile or prompt.
Returning to the flow visual editor,
recommender_with_LLM_evaluation
we can run the flow by clicking the Play button and observing the output.
You can run a single recommendation or run both variations when
prompted. The output of a single evaluation using the default inputs is
shown in the following listing.
Listing 9.1 LLM rubric evaluation output
{
"recommendations": "Title: The Butterfly Effect
Subject: 5
Format: 5
Genre: 4
Title: Primer
Subject: 5
Format: 5
Genre: 4
Title: Time Bandits
Subject: 5
Format: 5
Genre: 5"
}
We now have a rubric for grounding our recommender, and the evaluation
is run automatically using a second LLM prompt. In the next section, we
look at how to perform multiple evaluations simultaneously and then at a
total score for everything.
9.7 Comparing profiles: Getting the perfect
profile
With our understanding of rubrics and grounding, we can now move on to
evaluating and iterating the perfect profile. Before we do that, though, we
need to clean up the output from the LLM evaluation block. This will
require us to parse the recommendations into something more Pythonic,
which we’ll tackle in the next section.

## Page 378

9.7.1 Parsing the LLM evaluation output
As the raw output from the evaluation block is text, we now want to parse
that into something more usable. Of course, writing parsing functions is
simple, but there are better ways to cast responses automagically. We
covered better methods for returning responses in chapter 5, on agent
actions.
Open
chapter_09\prompt_flow\recommender_with_parsing\flow.dag.yaml
in VS Code, and look at the flow in the visual editor. Locate the
block, and click the link to open the Python file in the
parsing_results
editor, as shown in figure 9.20.
Figure 9.20 Opening the parsing_results.py file in VS Code

## Page 379

The code for the file is shown in listing 9.2.
parsing_results.py
Listing 9.2 parsing_results.py
from promptflow import tool

def parse_block(block):
lines = block.split('\n')
rdict = {}
for line in lines:
kvs = line.split(': ')
key, value = kvs[0], kvs[1]
rdict[key.lower()] = value #3
return rdict
parsed = [parse_block(block) for block in rblocks] #4
return parsed
#1 Special decorator to denote the tool block
#2 Splits the input and double new lines
#3 Creates a dictionary entry and sets the value
#4 Loops through each block and parses into key/value dictionary
We’re converting the recommendations output from listing 9.1, which is
just a string, into a dictionary. So this code will convert this string into the
JSON block shown next:
Before parsing:
"Title: The Butterfly Effect
Subject: 5
Format: 5
Genre: 4
Title: Primer
Subject: 5
Format: 5
Genre: 4
Title: Time Bandits
Subject: 5
Format: 5
Genre: 5"
After parsing:

## Page 380

{
"title": " The Butterfly Effect
"subject": "5",
"format": "5",
"genre": "4"
},
{
"title": " Primer",
"subject": "5",
"format": "5",
"genre": "4"
},
{
"title": " Time Bandits",
"subject": "5",
"format": "5",
"genre": "5"
}
The output of this block now gets passed to the output
parsing_results
and is wrapped in a list of recommendations. We can see what all this looks
like by running the flow.
Open for the flow in the visual editor, and click the Play
flow.dag.yaml
(Run All) button. Be sure to select to use both recommender variants.
You’ll see both variations run and output to the terminal.
At this point, we have a full working recommendation and LLM evaluation
flow that outputs a score for each criterion on each output. However, to do
comprehensive evaluations of a particular profile, we want to generate
multiple recommendations with various criteria. We’ll see how to do batch
processing of flows in the next section.
9.7.2 Running batch processing in prompt flow
In our generic recommendation profile, we want to evaluate how various
input criteria can affect the generated recommendations. Fortunately,
prompt flow can batch-process any variations we want to test. The limit is
only the time and money we want to spend.
To perform batch processing, we must first create a JSON Lines (JSONL)
or JSON list document of our input criteria. If you recall, our input criteria
looked like the following in JSON format:

## Page 381

{
"subject": "time travel",
"format": "books",
"genre": "fantasy",
"custom": "don't include any R rated content"
}
We want to create a list of JSON objects like that just shown, preferably in
a random manner. Of course, the simple way to do this is to prompt
ChatGPT to create a JSONL document using the following prompt:
I am developing a recommendation agent. The agent will
recommend anything given the following criteria:
1. subject - examples: time travel, cooking, vacation
2. format - examples: books, movies, games
3. genre: documentary, action, romance
4. custom: don't include any R rated content
Can you please generate a random list of these criteria and
output it in the format of a JSON Lines file, JSONL. Please
include 10 items in the list.
Try this out by going to ChatGPT and entering the preceding prompt. A
previously generated file can be found in the flow folder, called
. The contents of this file have been shown here
\bulk_recommend.jsonl
for reference:

## Page 382

}

## Page 383

With this bulk file, we can run both variants using the various input criteria
in the bulk JSONL file. Open the file in the visual editor,
flow.dag.yaml
click Batch (the beaker icon) to start the bulk-data loading process, and
select the file as shown in figure 9.21. For some operating systems, this
may appear as .

After the bulk file is selected, a new YAML document will open with a
Run link added at the bottom of the file, as shown in figure 9.22. Click the
link to do the batch run of inputs.

## Page 384

At this point, a few things will happen. The flow visual editor will appear,
and beside that a log file will open, showing the progress of the run. In the
terminal window, you’ll see the various worker processes spawning and
running.
Be patient. The batch run, even for 10 items, may take a few minutes or
seconds, depending on various factors such as hardware, previous calls,
and so on. Wait for the run to complete, and you’ll see a summary of
results in the terminal.
You can also view the run results by opening the prompt flow extension
and selecting the last run, as shown in figure 9.23. Then, you dig into each
run by clicking the table cells. A lot of information is exposed in this
dialog, which can help you troubleshoot flows and profiles.

## Page 385

A lot of information is captured during a batch run, and you can explore
much of it through the visualizer. More information can be found by
clicking the output folder link from the terminal window. This will open
another session of VS Code with the output folder allowing you to review
the run logs and other details.
Now that we’ve completed the batch run for each variant, we can apply
grounding and evaluate the results of both prompts. The next section will
use a new flow to perform the profile/prompt evaluation.

## Page 386

9.7.3 Creating an evaluation flow for grounding
Open in
chapter_3\prompt_flow\evaluate_groundings\flow.dag.yaml
the visual editor, as shown in figure 9.24. There are no LLM blocks in the
evaluation flow—just Python code blocks that will run the scoring and
then aggregate the scores.
Figure 9.24 Looking at the evaluate_groundings flow used to ground recommendation runs

## Page 387

We can now look at the code for the and blocks,
scoring aggregate
starting with the scoring code in listing 9.3. This scoring code averages the
score for each criterion into an average score. The output of the function is
a list of processed recommendations.
Listing 9.3 line_process.py
@tool
def line_process(recommendations: str): #1
inputs = recommendations
output = []
for data_dict in inputs: #2
total_score = 0
score_count = 0
for key, value in data_dict.items(): #2
if key != "title": #3
try:
total_score += float(value)
score_count += 1
data_dict[key] = float(value) #4
except:
pass
avg_score = total_score / score_count if score_count > 0 else 0
data_dict["avg_score"] = round(avg_score, 2) #5
output.append(data_dict)
return output
#1 A set of three recommendations is input into the function.
#2 Loops over each recommendation and criterion
#3 Title isn’t a criterion, so ignore it.
#4 Totals the score for all criteria and sets the float value to key
#5 Adds the average score as a grounding score of the recommendation
From the grounded recommendations, we can move on to aggregating the
scores with the block—the code for the block is
aggregate aggregate
shown in the following listing.

## Page 388

log_metric(key=key, value=value) #4
aggregated[key] = value
return aggregated
#1 The input is a list of lists; flatten to a list of items.
#2 Checks to see if the value is numeric and accumulates scores for each criterion key
#3 Loops over aggregated criterion scores
#4 Logs the criterion as a metric
The result of the aggregations will be a summary score for each criterion
and the average score. Since the evaluation/grounding flow is separate, it
can be run over any recommendation run we perform. This will allow us to
use the batch run results for any variation to compare results.
We can run the grounding flow by opening in the visual
flow.dag.yaml
editor and clicking Batch (beaker icon). Then, when prompted, we select
an existing run and then select the run we want to evaluate, as shown in
figure 9.25. This will open a YAML file with the Run link at the bottom, as
we’ve seen before. Click the Run link to run the evaluation.

## Page 389

After the run is completed, you’ll see a summary of the results in the
terminal window. You can click the output link to open the folder in VS
Code and analyze the results, but there is a better way to compare them.
Open the prompt flow extension, focus on the Batch Run History window,
and scroll down to the Run against Run section, as shown in figure 9.26.
Select the runs you want to compare—likely the ones near the top—so that
the checkmark appears. Then, right-click the run, and select the Visualize
Runs option. The Batch Run Visualization window opens, and you’ll see
the metrics for each of the runs at the top.

## Page 390

We can now see a significant difference between profile/prompt variation
0, the user prompt, and variation 1, the system prompt. Refer to figure 9.15
if you need a refresher on what the prompts/profiles look like. At this
point, it should be evident that injecting the input parameters into the
system prompt provides better recommendations.
You can now go back and try other profiles or other variant options to see
what effect this has on your recommendations. The possibilities are
virtually endless, but hopefully you can see what an excellent tool prompt
flow will be for building agent profiles and prompts.

Summary
An agent profile consists of several other component prompts that can
drive functions such as actions/tools, knowledge, memory, evaluation,
reasoning, feedback, and planning.
Prompt flow can be used to evaluate an agent’s component prompts.
Systemic prompt engineering is an iterative process evaluating a
prompt and agent profile.

## Page 393

The Test Changes Systematically strategy describes iterating and
evaluating prompts, and system prompt engineering implements this
strategy.
Agent profiles and prompt engineering have many similarities. We
define an agent profile as the combination of prompt engineering
elements that guide and help an agent through its task.
Prompt flow is an open source tool from Microsoft that provides
several features for developing and evaluating profiles and prompts.
An LLM connection in prompt flow supports additional parameters,
including temperature, stop token, max tokens, and other advanced
parameters.
LLM blocks support prompt and profile variants, which allow for
evaluating changes to the prompt/profile or other connection
parameters.
A rubric applied to an LLM prompt is the criteria and standards a
prompt/profile must fulfill to be grounded. Grounding is the scoring
and evaluation of a rubric.
Prompt flow supports running multiple variations as single runs or
batch runs.
In prompt flow, an evaluation flow is run after a generative flow to
score and aggregate the results. The Visualize Runs option can compare
the aggregated criteria from scoring the rubric across multiple runs.

10 Agent reasoning and evaluation
This chapter covers
Using various prompt engineering techniques to extend large
language model functions
Engaging large language models with prompt engineering techniques
that engage reasoning
Employing an evaluation prompt to narrow and identify the solution
to an unknown problem
Now that we’ve examined the patterns of memory and retrieval that define
the semantic memory component in agents, we can take a look at the last
and most instrumental component in agents: planning. Planning
encompasses many facets, from reasoning, understanding, and evaluation
to feedback.
To explore how LLMs can be prompted to reason, understand, and plan,
we’ll demonstrate how to engage reasoning through prompt engineering
and then expand that to planning. The planning solution provided by the
Semantic Kernel (SK) encompasses multiple planning forms. We’ll finish
the chapter by incorporating adaptive feedback into a new planner.
Figure 10.1 demonstrates the high-level prompt engineering strategies
we’ll cover in this chapter and how they relate to the various techniques
we’ll cover. Each of the methods showcased in the figure will be explored
in this chapter, from the basics of solution/direct prompting, shown in the
top-left corner, to self-consistency and tree of thought (ToT) prompting, in
the bottom right.

Figure 10.1 How the two planning prompt engineering strategies align with the various
techniques
10.1 Understanding direct solution prompting
Direct solution prompting is generally the first form of prompt engineering
that users employ when asking LLMs questions or solving a particular
problem. Given any LLM use, these techniques may seem apparent, but
they are worth reviewing to establish the foundation of thought and
planning. In the next section, we’ll start from the beginning, asking
questions and expecting answers.
10.1.1 Question-and-answer prompting
For the exercises in this chapter, we’ll employ prompt flow to build and
evaluate the various techniques. (We already extensively covered this tool
in chapter 9, so refer to that chapter if you need a review.) Prompt flow is
an excellent tool for understanding how these techniques work and
exploring the flow of the planning and reasoning process.
Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to the source folder.
chapter 10
Create a new virtual environment for the folder, and install the
file. If you need help setting up a chapter’s Python
requirements.txt
environment, refer to appendix B.
We’ll look at the first flow in the
prompt_flow/question-answering-
folder. Open the file in the visual editor, as
prompting flow.dag.yaml
shown in figure 10.2. On the right side, you’ll see the flow of components.
At the top is the LLM prompt, followed by two
question_answer
components and a final LLM prompt to do the evaluation called
Embedding
.
evaluate

## Page 397

Figure 10.2 The flow.dag.yaml file, open in the visual editor, highlighting the various
components of the flow
The breakdown in listing 10.1 shows the structure and components of the
flow in more detail using a sort of YAML-shortened pseudocode. You can
also see the input and outputs to the various components and a sample
output from running the flow.

## Page 398

Listing 10.1 question-answer-prompting flow
Inputs:
context : the content to ask the question about
question : question asked specific to the content
expected : the expected answer
LLM: Question-Answer (the prompt used to ask the question)
inputs:
context and question
outputs:
the prediction/answer to the question
Embeddings: uses an LLM embedding model to create the embedding
representation of the text
Embedding_predicted: embeds the output of the Question-Answer LLM
Embedding_expected: embeds the output of the expected answer
Python: Evaluation (Python code to measure embedding similarity)
Inputs:
Embedding_predicted output
Embedding_expected output
Outputs:
the similarity score between predicted and expected
Outputs:
context: -> input.context
question: -> input.question
expected: -> input.expected
predicted: -> output.question_answer
evaluation_score: output.evaluation
### Example Output
{
"context": "Back to the Future (1985)…",
"evaluation_score": 0.9567478002354606,
"expected": "Marty traveled back in time 30 years.",
"predicted": "Marty traveled back in time 30 years from 1985 to 1955
in the movie \"Back to the Future.\"",
"question": "How far did Marty travel back in time in the movie
Back to the Future (1985)"
}
Before running this flow, make sure your LLM block is configured
correctly. This may require you to set up a connection to your chosen
LLM. Again, refer to chapter 9 if you need a review on how to complete
this. You’ll need to configure the LLM and blocks with your
Embedding
connection if you’re not using OpenAI.
After configuring your LLM connection, run the flow by clicking the Play
button from the visual editor or using the Test (Shift-F5) link in the YAML
editor window. If everything is connected and configured correctly, you
should see output like that in listing 10.1.

## Page 399

Open the file in VS Code, as shown in listing
question_answer.jinja2
10.2. This listing shows the basic question-and-answer-style prompt. In
this style of prompt, the system message describes the basic rules and
provides the context to answer the question. In chapter 4, we explored the
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pattern, and this prompt follows a
similar pattern.
Listing 10.2 question_answer.jinja2
system:
Answer the users question based on the context below. Keep the answer
short and concise. Respond "Unsure about answer" if not sure about the
answer.
Context: {{context}} #1
user:
Question: {{question}} #2
#1 Replace with the content LLM should answer the question about.
#2 Replace with the question.
This exercise shows the simple method of using an LLM to ask questions
about a piece of content. Then, the question response is evaluated using a
similarity matching score. We can see from the output in listing 10.1 that
the LLM does a good job of answering a question about the context. In the
next section, we’ll explore a similar technique that uses direct prompting.
10.1.2 Implementing few-shot prompting
Few-shot prompting is like question-and-answer prompting, but the
makeup of the prompt is more about providing a few examples than about
facts or context. This allows the LLM to bend to patterns or content not
previously seen. While this approach sounds like question and answer, the
implementation is quite different, and the results can be powerful.

## Page 400

ZERO-SHOT, ONE-SHOT, AND FEW-SHOT LEARNING
One holy grail of machine learning and AI is the ability to train a model
on as few items as possible. For example, in traditional vision models,
millions of images are fed into the model to help identify the differences
between a cat and a dog.
A one-shot model is a model that requires only a single image to train it.
For example, a picture of a cat can be shown, and then the model can
identify any cat image. A few-shot model requires only a few things to
train the model. And, of course, zero-shot indicates the ability to identify
something given no previous examples. LLMs are efficient learners and
can do all three types of learning.
Open in VS Code and
prompt_flow/few-shot-prompting/flow.dag.yaml
the visual editor. Most of the flow looks like the one pictured earlier in
figure 10.2, and the differences are highlighted in listing 10.3, which
shows a YAML pseudocode representation. The main differences between
this and the previous flow are the inputs and LLM prompt.

## Page 401

Listing 10.3 few-shot-prompting flow
Inputs:
statement : introduces the context and then asks for output
expected : the expected answer to the statement
LLM: few_shot (the prompt used to ask the question)
inputs:statement
outputs: the prediction/answer to the statement
Embeddings: uses an LLM embedding model to create the embedding
representation of the text
Embedding_predicted: embeds the output of the few_shot LLM
Embedding_expected: embeds the output of the expected answer
Python: Evaluation (Python code to measure embedding similarity)
Inputs:
Embedding_predicted output
Embedding_expected output
Outputs: the similarity score between predicted and expected
Outputs:
statement: -> input.statement
expected: -> input.expected
predicted: -> output.few_shot
evaluation_score: output.evaluation
### Example Output
{
"evaluation_score": 0.906647282920417, #1
"expected": "We ate sunner and watched the setting sun.",
"predicted": "After a long hike, we sat by the lake
and enjoyed a peaceful sunner as the sky turned
brilliant shades of orange and pink.", #2
"statement": "A sunner is a meal we eat in Cananda
at sunset, please use the word in a sentence" #3
}
#1 Evaluation score represents the similarity between expected and predicted.
#2 Uses sunner in a sentence
#3 This is a false statement but the intent is to get the LLM to use the word as if it was real.
Run the flow by pressing Shift-F5 or clicking the Play/Test button from the
visual editor. You should see output like listing 10.3 where the LLM has
used the word sunner (a made-up term) correctly in a sentence given the
initial statement.
This exercise demonstrates the ability to use a prompt to alter the behavior
of the LLM to be contrary to what it has learned. We’re changing what the
LLM understands to be accurate. Furthermore, we then use that modified
perspective to elicit the use of a made-up word.
Open the prompt in VS Code, shown in listing 10.4.
few_shot.jinja2
This listing demonstrates setting up a simple persona, that of an eccentric

## Page 402

dictionary maker, and then providing examples of words it has defined and
used before. The base of the prompt allows for the LLM to extend the
examples and produce similar results using other words.
Listing 10.4 few_shot.jinja2
system:
You are an eccentric word dictionary maker. You will be asked to
construct a sentence using the word.
The following are examples that demonstrate how to craft a sentence using
the word.
A "whatpu" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania.
An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is: #1
We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus.
To do a "farduddle" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a
sentence that uses the word farduddle is:
I was so excited that I started to farduddle. #2
Please only return the sentence requested by the user. #3
user:
{{statement}} #4
#1 Demonstrates an example defining a made-up word and using it in a sentence
#2 Demonstrates another example
#3 A rule to prevent the LLM from outputting extra information
#4 The input statement defines a new word and asks for the use.
You may say we’re forcing the LLM to hallucinate here, but this technique
is the basis for modifying behavior. It allows prompts to be constructed to
guide an LLM to do everything contrary to what it learned. This
foundation of prompting also establishes techniques for other forms of
altered behavior. From the ability to alter the perception and background of
an LLM, we’ll move on to demonstrate a final example of a direct solution
in the next section.
10.1.3 Extracting generalities with zero-shot prompting
Zero-shot prompting or learning is the ability to generate a prompt in such
a manner that allows the LLM to generalize. This generalization is
embedded within the LLM and demonstrated through zero-shot prompting,
where no examples are given, but instead a set of guidelines or rules are
given to guide the LLM.

## Page 403

Employing this technique is simple and works well to guide the LLM to
generate replies given its internal knowledge and no other contexts. It’s a
subtle yet powerful technique that applies the knowledge of the LLM to
other applications. This technique, combined with other prompting
strategies, is proving effective at replacing other language classification
models—models that identify the emotion or sentiment in text, for
example.
Open in the VS
prompt_flow/zero-shot-prompting/flow.dag.yaml
Code prompt flow visual editor. This flow is again almost identical to that
shown earlier in figure 10.1 but differs slightly in implementation, as
shown in listing 10.5.
Listing 10.5 zero-shot-prompting flow
Inputs:
statement : the statement to be classified
expected : the expected classification of the statement
LLM: zero_shot (the prompt used to classify)
inputs: statement
outputs: the predicted class given the statement
Embeddings: uses an LLM embedding model to create the embedding
representation of the text
Embedding_predicted: embeds the output of the zero_shot LLM
Embedding_expected: embeds the output of the expected answer
Python: Evaluation (Python code to measure embedding similarity)
Inputs:
Embedding_predicted output
Embedding_expected output
Outputs: the similarity score between predicted and expected
Outputs:
statement: -> input.statement
expected: -> input.expected
predicted: -> output.few_shot
evaluation_score: output.evaluation
### Example Output
{
"evaluation_score": 1, #1
"expected": "neutral",
"predicted": "neutral",
"statement": "I think the vacation is okay. " #2
}
#1 Shows a perfect evaluation score of 1.0
#2 The statement we’re asking the LLM to classify

## Page 404

Run the flow by pressing Shift-F5 within the VS Code prompt flow visual
editor. You should see output similar to that shown in listing 10.5.
Now open the prompt as shown in listing 10.6. The
zero_shot.jinja2
prompt is simple and uses no examples to extract the sentiment from the
text. What is especially interesting to note is that the prompt doesn’t even
mention the phrase sentiment, and the LLM seems to understand the intent.
Listing 10.6 zero_shot.jinja2
system:
Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive.
Return on the result and nothing else. #1
user:
{{statement}} #2
#1 Provides essential guidance on performing the classification
#2 The statement of text to classify
Zero-shot prompt engineering is about using the ability of the LLM to
generalize broadly based on its training material. This exercise
demonstrates how knowledge within the LLM can be put to work for other
tasks. The LLM’s ability to self-contextualize and apply knowledge can
extend beyond its training. In the next section, we extend this concept
further by looking at how LLMs can reason.
10.2 Reasoning in prompt engineering
LLMs like ChatGPT were developed to function as chat completion
models, where text content is fed into the model, whose responses align
with completing that request. LLMs were never trained to reason, plan,
think, or have thoughts.
However, much like we demonstrated with the examples in the previous
section, LLMs can be prompted to extract their generalities and be
extended beyond their initial design. While an LLM isn’t designed to
reason, the training material fed into the model provides an understanding
of reasoning, planning, and thought. Therefore, by extension, an LLM
understands what reasoning is and can employ the concept of reasoning.

## Page 405

REASONING AND PLANNING
Reasoning is the ability of an intellect, artificial or not, to understand the
process of thought or thinking through a problem. An intellect can
understand that actions have outcomes, and it can use this ability to
reason through which action from a set of actions can be applied to solve
a given task.
Planning is the ability of the intellect to reason out the order of actions
or tasks and apply the correct parameters to achieve a goal or outcome—
the extent to which an intellectual plan depends on the scope of the
problem. An intellect may combine multiple levels of planning, from
strategic and tactical to operational and contingent.
We’ll look at another set of prompt engineering techniques that allow or
mimic reasoning behavior to demonstrate this reasoning ability. Typically,
when evaluating the application of reasoning, we look to having the LLM
solve challenging problems it wasn’t designed to solve. A good source of
such is based on logic, math, and word problems.
Using the time travel theme, what class of unique problems could be better
to solve than understanding time travel? Figure 10.3 depicts one example
of a uniquely challenging time travel problem. Our goal is to acquire the
ability to prompt the LLM in a manner that allows it to solve the problem
correctly.

## Page 406

Figure 10.3 The complexity of the time travel problems we intend to solve using LLMs with
reasoning and planning
Time travel problems are thought exercises that can be deceptively difficult
to solve. The example in figure 10.3 is complicated to solve for an LLM,
but the part it gets wrong may surprise you. The next section will use
reasoning in prompts to solve these unique problems.
10.2.1 Chain of thought prompting
Chain of thought (CoT)prompting is a prompt engineering technique that
employs the one-shot or few-shot examples that describe the reasoning and

## Page 407

the steps to accomplish a desired goal. Through the demonstration of
reasoning, the LLM can generalize this principle and reason through
similar problems and goals. While the LLM isn’t trained with the goal of
reasoning, we can elicit the model to reason, using prompt engineering.
Open in the
prompt_flow/chain-of-thought-prompting/flow.dag.yaml
VS Code prompt flow visual editor. The elements of this flow are simple,
as shown in figure 10.4. With only two LLM blocks, the flow first uses a
CoT prompt to solve a complex question; then, the second LLM prompt
evaluates the answer.

## Page 408

Figure 10.4 The flow of the CoT

## Page 409

Listing 10.7 shows the YAML pseudocode that describes the blocks and
the inputs/outputs of the flow in more detail. The default problem
statement in this example isn’t the same as in figure 10.3.
Listing 10.7 chain-of-thought-prompting flow
Inputs:
statement : the statement problem to be solved
expected : the expected solution to the problem
LLM: cot (the prompt used to solve the problem)
inputs: statement
outputs: the predicted answer given the problem statement
LLM: evaluate_answer (the prompt used to evaluate the solution)
inputs:
statement: -> input.statement
expected: -> input.expected
predicted: -> output.cot
outputs: a score of how well the problem was answered
Outputs:
statement: -> input.statement
expected: -> input.expected
predicted: -> output.cot
evaluation_score: output.evaluate_answer
### Example Output
{
"evaluation_score": "0.5", #1
"expected": "After the final jump, Max finds himself
in the year 1980 and he is 75 years old.", #2
"predicted": " Max starts in the year 2300 and
travels backward in 40-year increments, spending 5 years
in each period. The journeys will be as follows:
\n\n- From 2300 to 2260: Max is 25 + 5 = 30 years old.
\n- From 2260 to 2220: Max is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.
\n- From 2220 to 2180: Max is 35 + 5 = 40 years old.
\n- From 2180 to 2140: Max is 40 + 5 = 45 years old.
\n- From 2140 to 2100: Max is 45 + 5 = 50 years old.
\n- From 2100 to 2060: Max is 50 + 5 = 55 years old.
\n- From 2060 to 2020: Max is 55 + 5 = 60 years old.
\n- From 2020 to 1980: Max is 60 + 5 = 65 years old.
\n- From 1980 to 1940: Max is 65 + 5 = 70 years old.
\n- From 1940 to 1900: Max is 70 + 5" #3
}
#1 The evaluated score for the given solution
#2 The expected answer for the problem
#3 The predicted answer shows the reasoning steps and output.
Dig into the inputs and check the problem statement; try to evaluate the
problem yourself. Then, run the flow by pressing Shift-F5. You should see
output similar to that shown in listing 10.7.

## Page 410

Open the prompt file as shown in listing 10.8. This prompt
cot.jinja2
gives a few examples of time travel problems and then the thought-out and
reasoned solution. The process of showing the LLM the steps to complete
the problem provides the reasoning mechanism.

## Page 411

Listing 10.8 cot.jinja2
system:
"In a time travel movie, Sarah travels back in time to
prevent a historic event from happening. She arrives
2 days before the event. After spending a day preparing,
she attempts to change the event but realizes she has
actually arrived 2 years early, not 2 days. She then
decides to wait and live in the past until the event's
original date. How many days does Sarah spend in the past
before the day of the event?" #1
Chain of Thought: #2
Initial Assumption: Sarah thinks she has arrived 2 days before the event.
Time Spent on Preparation: 1 day spent preparing.
Realization of Error: Sarah realizes she's actually 2 years early.
Conversion of Years to Days:
2 years = 2 × 365 = 730 days (assuming non-leap years).
Adjust for the Day Spent Preparing: 730 - 1 = 729 days.
Conclusion: Sarah spends 729 days in the past before the day of the event.
"In a sci-fi film, Alex is a time traveler who decides
to go back in time to witness a famous historical battle
that took place 100 years ago, which lasted for 10 days.
He arrives three days before the battle starts. However,
after spending six days in the past, he jumps forward in
time by 50 years and stays there for 20 days. Then, he
travels back to witness the end of the battle. How many
days does Alex spend in the past before he sees the end of
the battle?" #3
Chain of Thought: #4
Initial Travel: Alex arrives three days before the battle starts.
Time Spent Before Time Jump: Alex spends six days in the past.
The battle has started and has been going on for 3 days (since he
arrived 3 days early and has now spent 6 days, 3 + 3 = 6).
First Time Jump: Alex jumps 50 years forward and stays for 20 days.
This adds 20 days to the 6 days he's already spent in the past
(6 + 20 = 26).
Return to the Battle: When Alex returns, he arrives back on the same
day he left (as per time travel logic). The battle has been going on for
3 days now.
Waiting for the Battle to End: The battle lasts 10 days. Since he's
already witnessed 3 days of it, he needs to wait for 7 more days.
Conclusion: Alex spends a total of 3 (initial wait) + 3 (before the
first jump) + 20 (50 years ago) + 7 (after returning) = 33 days in the
past before he sees the end of the battle.
Think step by step but only show the final answer to the statement.

You may note that the solution to figure 10.3 is also provided as an
example in listing 10.8. It’s also helpful to go back and review listing 10.7
for the reply from the LLM about the problem. From this, you can see the
reasoning steps the LLM applied to get its final answer.
Now, we can look at the prompt that evaluates how well the solution
solved the problem. Open , shown in listing
evaluate_answer.jinja2
10.9, to review the prompt used. The prompt is simple, uses zero-shot
prompting, and allows the LLM to generalize how it should score the
expected and predicted. We could provide examples and scores, thus
changing this to an example of a few-shot classification.
Listing 10.9 evaluate_answer.jinja2
system:
Please confirm that expected and predicted results are
the same for the given problem. #1
Return a score from 0 to 1 where 1 is a perfect match and 0 is no match.
Please just return the score and not the explanation. #2

Predicted result: {{predicted}} #5
#1 The rules for evaluating the solution
#2 Direction to only return the score and nothing else
#3 The initial problem statement
#4 The expected or grounded answer
#5 The output from the CoT prompt earlier
Looking at the LLM output shown earlier in listing 10.7, you can see why
the evaluation step may get confusing. Perhaps a fix to this could be
suggesting to the LLM to provide the final answer in a single statement. In
the next section, we move on to another example of prompt reasoning.
10.2.2 Zero-shot CoT prompting
As our time travel demonstrates, CoT prompting can be expensive in terms
of prompt generation for a specific class of problem. While not as
effective, there are techniques similar to CoT that don’t use examples and

## Page 413

can be more generalized. This section will examine a straightforward
phrase employed to elicit reasoning in LLMs.
Open in the VS
prompt_flow/zero-shot-cot-prompting/flow.dag.yaml
Code prompt flow visual editor. This flow is very similar to the previous
CoT, as shown in figure 10.4. The next lsting shows the YAML
pseudocode that describes the flow.
Listing 10.10 zero-shot-CoT-prompting flow
Inputs:
statement : the statement problem to be solved
expected : the expected solution to the problem
LLM: cot (the prompt used to solve the problem)
inputs: statement
outputs: the predicted answer given the problem statement
LLM: evaluate_answer (the prompt used to evaluate the solution)
inputs:
statement: -> input.statement
expected: -> input.expected
predicted: -> output.cot
outputs: a score of how well the problem was answered
Outputs:
statement: -> input.statement
expected: -> input.expected
predicted: -> output.cot
evaluation_score: output.evaluate_answer
### Example Output
{
"evaluation_score": "1", #1
"expected": "After the final jump, ↪
↪ Max finds himself in the year 1980 and
he is 75 years old.", #2
"predicted": "Max starts in… ↪
↪ Therefore, after the final jump, ↪
↪ Max is 75 years old and in the year 1980.", #3
"statement": "In a complex time travel …" #4
}
#1 The final evaluation score
#2 The expected answer
#3 The predicted answer (the steps have been omitted showing the final answer)
#4 The initial problem statement
Run/test the flow in VS Code by pressing Shift-F5 while in the visual
editor. The flow will run, and you should see output similar to that shown

in listing 10.10. This exercise example performs better than the previous
example on the same problem.
Open the prompt in VS Code, as shown in listing 10.11. This
cot.jinja2
is a much simpler prompt than the previous example because it only uses
zero-shot. However, one key phrase turns this simple prompt into a
powerful reasoning engine. The line in the prompt

triggers the LLM to consider internal context showing reasoning.
step
This, in turn, directs the LLM to reason out the problem in steps.

You are given a time travel problem and you have to solve it.

#1 A magic line that formulates reasoning from the LLM
#2 Asks the LLM to provide a final statement of the answer
#3 The problem statement the LLM is asked to solve
Similar phrases asking the LLM to think about the steps or asking it to
respond in steps also extract reasoning. We’ll demonstrate a similar but
more elaborate technique in the next section.
10.2.3 Step by step with prompt chaining
We can extend the behavior of asking an LLM to think step by step into a
chain of prompts that force the LLM to solve the problem in steps. In this
section, we look at a technique called prompt chaining that forces an LLM
to process problems in steps.
Open the file in the
prompt_flow/prompt-chaining/flow.dag.yaml
visual editor, as shown in figure 10.5. Prompt chaining breaks up the
reasoning method used to solve a problem into chains of prompts. This
technique forces the LLM to answer the problem in terms of steps.

## Page 415

[No extractable text]

## Page 416

Figure 10.5 The prompt chaining flow
Listing 10.12 shows the YAML pseudocode that describes the flow in a
few more details. This flow chains the output of the first LLM block into
the second and then from the second into the third. Forcing the LLM to
process the problem this way uncovers the reasoning pattern, but it can
also be overly verbose.
Listing 10.12 prompt-chaining flow
Inputs:
statement : the statement problem to be solved
LLM: decompose_steps (the prompt used to decompose the problem)
inputs:
statement: -> input.statement #1
outputs: the breakdown of steps to solve the problem
LLM: calculate_steps (the prompt used to calculate the steps)
inputs:
statement: -> input.statement
decompose_steps: -> output.decompose_steps #2
outputs: the calculation for each step
LLM: calculate_solution (attempts to solve the problem)
inputs:
statement: -> input.statement
decompose_steps: -> output.decompose_steps
calculate_steps: -> output.calculate_steps #3
outputs: the final solution statement
Outputs:
statement: -> input.statement
decompose_steps: -> output.decompose_steps
calculate_steps: -> output.calculate_steps
calculate_solution: -> output.calculate_solution
### Example Output
{
"calculate_steps": "1. The days spent by Alex",
"decompose_steps": "To figure out the …",
"solution": "Alex spends 13 days in the ↪
↪ past before the end of the battle.", #4
"statement": "In a sci-fi film, Alex …"
}
#1 Start of the chain of prompts
#2 Output from the previous step injected into this step
#3 Output from two previous steps injected into this step
#4 The final solution statement, although wrong, is closer.
Run the flow by pressing Shift-F5 from the visual editor, and you’ll see the
output as shown in listing 10.12. The answer is still not correct for the Alex

problem, but we can see all the work the LLM is doing to reason out the
problem.
Open up all three prompts: ,
decompose_steps.jinja2
, and (see listings
calculate_steps.jinja2 calculate_solution.jinja2
10.13, 10.14, and 10.15, respectively). All three prompts shown in the
listings can be compared to show how outputs chain together.

In this exercise example, we’re not performing any evaluation and scoring.
Without the evaluation, we can see that this sequence of prompts still has
problems solving our more challenging time travel problem shown earlier
in figure 10.3. However, that doesn’t mean this technique doesn’t have
value, and this prompting format solves some complex problems well.
What we want to find, however, is a reasoning and planning methodology
that can solve such complex problems consistently. The following section
moves from reasoning to evaluating the best solution.
10.3 Employing evaluation for consistent
solutions
In the previous section, we learned that even the best-reasoned plans may
not always derive the correct solution. Furthermore, we may not always
have the answer to confirm if that solution is correct. The reality is that we
often want to use some form of evaluation to determine the efficacy of a
solution.
Figure 10.6 shows a comparison of the prompt engineering strategies that
have been devised as a means of getting LLMs to reason and plan. We’ve
already covered the two on the left: zero-shot direct prompting and CoT

## Page 419

prompting. The following example exercises in this section will look at
self-consistency with the CoT and ToT techniques.
Figure 10.6 Comparing the various prompt engineering strategies to enable reasoning and
planning from LLMs
We’ll continue to focus on the complex time travel problem to compare
these more advanced methods that expand on reasoning and planning with
evaluation. In the next section, we’ll evaluate self-consistency.
10.3.1 Evaluating self-consistency prompting
Consistency in prompting is more than just lowering the temperature
parameter we send to an LLM. Often, we want to generate a consistent
plan or solution and still use a high temperature to better evaluate all the
variations to a plan. By evaluating multiple different plans, we can get a
better sense of the overall value of a solution.

## Page 420

Self-consistent prompting is the technique of generating multiple
plans/solutions for a given problem. Then, those plans are evaluated, and
the more frequent or consistent plan is accepted. Imagine three plans
generated, where two are similar, but the third is different. Using self-
consistency, we evaluate the first two plans as the more consistent answer.
Open in the
prompt_flow/self-consistency-prompting/flow.dag.yaml
VS Code prompt flow visual editor. The flow diagram shows the simplicity
of the prompt generation flow in figure 10.7. Next to it in the diagram is
the self-consistency evaluation flow.

## Page 421

Figure 10.7 The self-consistency prompt generation beside the evaluation flow
Prompt flow uses a direct acyclic graph (DAG) format to execute the flow
logic. DAGs are an excellent way of demonstrating and executing flow
logic, but because they are acyclic, meaning they can’t repeat, they can’t

## Page 422

execute loops. However, because prompt flow provides a batch processing
mechanism, we can use that to simulate loops or repetition in a flow.
Referring to figure 10.6, we can see that self-consistency processes the
input three times before collecting the results and determining the best
plan/reply. We can apply this same pattern but use batch processing to
generate the outputs. Then, the evaluation flow will aggregate the results
and determine the best answer.
Open the prompt template in
self-consistency-prompting/cot.jinja2
VS Code (see listing 10.16). The listing was shortened, as we’ve seen parts
before. This prompt uses two (few-shot prompt) examples of a CoT to
demonstrate the thought reasoning to the LLM.
Listing 10.16 self-consistency-prompting/cot.jinja2
system:
"In a time travel movie, Sarah travels back… " #1
Chain of Thought:
Initial Assumption: … #2
Conclusion: Sarah spends 729 days in the past before the day of the event.
"In a complex time travel movie plot, Max, a 25 year old…" #3
Chain of Thought:
Starting Point: Max starts … #4
Conclusion: After the final jump,
Max finds himself in the year 1980 and he is 75 years old.

but only show the final answer to the statement. #5

You can view the flow produced by pressing the Ctrl key and clicking the
output link, highlighted in listing 10.17. This will open another instance of
VS Code, showing a folder with all the output from the run. We now want
to check the most consistent answer. Fortunately, the evaluation feature in
prompt flow can help us identify consistent answers using similarity
matching.
Open in VS Code (see
self-consistency-evaluation/flow.dag.yaml
figure 10.7). This flow embeds the predicted answer and then uses an
aggregation to determine the most consistent answer.
From the flow, open in VS Code, as shown in listing
consistency.py
10.18. The code for this tool function calculates the cosine similarity for all

## Page 426

pairs of answers. Then, it finds the most similar answer, logs it, and outputs
that as the answer.
Listing 10.18 consistency.py
from promptflow import tool
from typing import List
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine
@tool
def consistency(texts: List[str],
embeddings: List[List[float]]) -> str:
if len(embeddings) != len(texts):
raise ValueError("The number of embeddings ↪
↪ must match the number of texts.")
mean_embedding = np.mean(embeddings, axis=0) #1
similarities = [1 - cosine(embedding, mean_embedding) ↪
↪ for embedding in embeddings] #2
most_similar_index = np.argmax(similarities) #3
from promptflow import log_metric
log_metric(key="highest_ranked_output", value=texts[most_similar_index]) #4
return texts[most_similar_index] #5
#1 Calculates the mean of all the embeddings
#2 Calculates cosine similarity for each pair of embeddings
#3 Finds the index of the most similar answer
#4 Logs the output as a metric
#5 Returns the text for the most similar answer
We need to run the evaluation flow in batch mode as well. Open
self-
in VS Code and run the flow in
consistency-evaluation/flow.dag.yaml
batch mode (beaker icon). Then, select Existing Run as the flow input, and
when prompted, choose the top or the last run you just executed as input.
Again, after the flow completes processing, you’ll see an output like that
shown in listing 10.17. Ctrl-click on the output folder link to open a new
instance of VS Code showing the results. Locate and open the
file in VS Code, as shown in figure 10.9.
metric.json

## Page 427

Figure 10.9 The VS Code is open to the batch run output folder. Highlighted are the
metrics.json file and the output showing the most similar answer.
The answer shown in figure 10.9 is still incorrect for this run. You can
continue a few more batch runs of the prompt and/or increase the number
of runs in a batch and then evaluate flows to see if you get better answers.
This technique is generally more helpful for more straightforward

## Page 428

problems but still demonstrates an inability to reason out complex
problems.
Self-consistency uses a reflective approach to evaluate the most likely
thought. However, the most likely thing is certainly not always the best.
Therefore, we must consider a more comprehensive approach in the next
section.
10.3.2 Evaluating tree of thought prompting
As mentioned earlier, ToT prompting, as shown in figure 10.6, combines
self-evaluation and prompt chaining techniques. As such, it breaks down
the sequence of planning into a chain of prompts, but at each step in the
chain, it provides for multiple evaluations. This creates a tree that can be
executed and evaluated at each level, breadth-first, or from top to bottom,
depth-first.
Figure 10.10 shows the difference between executing a tree using breadth-
first or depth-first. Unfortunately, due to the DAG execution pattern of
prompt flow, we can’t quickly implement the depth-first method, but
breadth-first works just fine.

## Page 429

Figure 10.10 Breadth-first vs. depth-first execution on a ToT pattern
Open in VS Code. The
tree-of-thought-evaluation/flow.dag.yaml
visual of the flow is shown in figure 10.11. This flow functions like a
breadth-first ToT pattern—the flow chains together a series of prompts
asking the LLM to return multiple plans at each step.

## Page 430

Figure 10.11 ToT pattern expressed and prompt flow
Because the flow executes in a breadth-first style, each level output of the
nodes is also evaluated. Each node in the flow uses a pair of semantic
functions—one to generate the answer and the other to evaluate the answer.
The semantic function is a custom Python flow block that processes
multiple inputs and generates multiple outputs.

## Page 431

Listing 10.19 shows the tool. This general tool is
semantic_function.py
reused for multiple blocks in this flow. It also demonstrates the embedding
functionality from the SK for direct use within prompt flow.

## Page 432

) -> str:

return ""

# code for setting up the kernel and LLM connection omitted
function = kernel.create_semantic_function(

async def main():
query = f"{history}\n{input}"
try:
eval = int((await evaluation.invoke_async(query)).result)
if eval > 25: #5
return await function.invoke_async(query) #6
except Exception as e:
raise Exception("Evaluation failed", e)
try:
result = asyncio.run(main()).result
return result
except Exception as e:
print(e)
return ""
#1 Uses a union to allow for different types of LLM connections
#2 Checks to see if the input is empty or None; if so, the function shouldn’t be executed.
#3 Sets up the generation function that creates a plan
#4 Sets up the evaluation function
#5 Runs the evaluate function and determines if the input is good enough to continue
#6 If the evaluation score is high enough, generates the next step

## Page 433

The semantic function tool is used in the tree’s experts, nodes, and answer
blocks. At each step, the function determines if any text is being input. If
there is no text, the block returns with no execution. Passing no text to a
block means that the previous block failed evaluation. By evaluating
before each step, ToT short-circuits the execution of plans it deems as not
being valid.
This may be a complex pattern to grasp at first, so go ahead and run the
flow in VS Code. Listing 10.20 shows just the answer node output of a run;
these results may vary from what you see but should be similar. Nodes that
return no text either failed evaluation or their parents did.
Listing 10.20 Output from tree-of-thought-evaluation flow
{
"answer_1_1": "", #1
"answer_1_2": "",
"answer_1_3": "",
"answer_2_1": "Alex spends a total of 29 days in the past before he
sees the end of the battle.",
"answer_2_2": "", #2
"answer_2_3": "Alex spends a total of 29 days in the past before he
sees the end of the battle.",
"answer_3_1": "", #3
"answer_3_2": "Alex spends a total of 29 days in the past before he
sees the end of the battle.",
"answer_3_3": "Alex spends a total of 9 days in the past before he
sees the end of the battle.",
#1 Represents that the first node plans weren’t valid and not executed
#2 The plan for node 2 and answer 2 failed evaluation and wasn’t run.
#3 The plan for this node failed to evaluate and wasn’t run.
The output in listing 10.20 shows how only a select set of nodes was
evaluated. In most cases, the evaluated nodes returned an answer that could
be valid. Where no output was produced, it means that the node itself or its
parent wasn’t valid. When sibling nodes all return empty, the parent node
fails to evaluate.
As we can see, ToT is valid for complex problems but perhaps not very
practical. The execution of this flow can take up to 27 calls to an LLM to
generate an output. In practice, it may only do half that many calls, but
that’s still a dozen or more calls to answer a single problem.

## Page 435

Summary
Direct solution prompting is a foundational method of using prompts to
direct LLMs toward solving specific problems or tasks, emphasizing
the importance of clear question-and-answer structures.
Few-shot prompting provides LLMs with a few examples to guide them
in handling new or unseen content, highlighting its power in enabling
the model to adapt to unfamiliar patterns.
Zero-shot learning and prompting demonstrate how LLMs can
generalize from their training to solve problems without needing
explicit examples, showcasing their inherent ability to understand and
apply knowledge in new contexts.
Chain of thought prompting guides the LLMs through a reasoning
process step by step to solve complex problems, illustrating how to
elicit detailed reasoning from the model.
Prompt chaining breaks down a problem into a series of prompts that
build upon each other, showing how to structure complex problem-
solving processes into manageable steps for LLMs.
Self-consistency is a prompt technique that generates multiple solutions
to a problem and selects the most consistent answer through evaluation,
emphasizing the importance of consistency in achieving reliable
outcomes.
Tree of thought prompting combines self-evaluation and prompt
chaining to create a comprehensive strategy for tackling complex
problems, allowing for a systematic exploration of multiple solution
paths.
Advanced prompt engineering strategies provide insights into
sophisticated techniques such as self-consistency with CoT and ToT,
offering methods to increase the accuracy and reliability of LLM-
generated solutions.

11 Agent planning and feedback
This chapter covers
Planning for an LLM and implementing it in agents and assistants
Using the OpenAI Assistants platform via custom actions
Implementing/testing a generic planner on LLMs
Using the feedback mechanism in advanced models
Planning, reasoning, evaluation, and feedback in building agentic
systems
Now that we’ve examined how large language models (LLMs) can reason
and plan, this chapter takes this concept a step further by employing
planning within an agent framework. Planning should be at the core of any
agent/assistant platform or toolkit. We’ll start by looking at the basics of
planning and how to implement a planner through prompting. Then, we’ll
see how planning operates using the OpenAI Assistants platform, which
automatically incorporates planning. From there, we’ll build and implement
a general planner for LLMs.
Planning can only go so far, and an often-unrecognized element is
feedback. Therefore, in the last sections of the chapter, we explore feedback
and implement it within a planner. You must be familiar with the content of
chapter 10, so please review it if you need to, and when you’re ready, let’s
begin planning.
11.1 Planning: The essential tool for all
agents/assistants
Agents and assistants who can’t plan and only follow simple interactions
are nothing more than chatbots. As we’ve seen throughout this book, our
goal isn’t to build bots but rather to build autonomous thinking agents—
agents that can take a goal, work out how to solve it, and then return with
the results.

## Page 437

Figure 11.1 explains the overall planning process that the agent/assistant
will undertake. This figure was also presented in chapter 1, but let’s review
it now in more detail. At the top of the figure, a user submits a goal. In an
agentic system, the agent takes the goal, constructs the plan, executes it, and
then returns the results.

## Page 438

Figure 11.1 The agent planning process
Depending on your interaction with platforms such as ChatGPT and GPTs,
Claude, and others, you may have already encountered a planning assistant
and not even noticed. Planning is becoming ubiquitous and is now built into

## Page 439

most commercial platforms to make the model appear more intelligent and
capable. Therefore, in the next exercise, we’ll look at an example to set a
baseline and differentiate between an LLM that can’t plan and an agent that
can.
For the next exercise, we’ll use Nexus to demonstrate how raw LLMs can’t
plan independently. If you need assistance installing, setting up, and
running Nexus, refer to chapter 7. After you have Nexus installed and ready,
we can begin running it with the Gradio interface, using the commands
shown next.
Listing 11.1 Running Nexus with the Gradio interface
nexus run gradio
Gradio is an excellent web interface tool built to demonstrate Python
machine learning projects. Figure 11.2 shows the Gradio Nexus interface
and the process for creating an agent and using an agent engine (OpenAI,
Azure, and Groq) of your choice. You can’t use LM Studio unless the
model/server supports tool/action use. Anthropic’s Claude supports internal
planning, so for the purposes of this exercise, avoid using this model.

## Page 440

Figure 11.2 Creating a new agent in Nexus
After creating the agent, we want to give it specific actions (tools) to
undertake or complete a goal. Generally, providing only the actions an
agent needs to complete its goal is best for a few reasons:
More actions can confuse an agent into deciding which to use or even
how to solve a goal.

## Page 441

APIs have limits on the number of tools that can be submitted; at the
time of writing, hitting this limit is relatively easy.
Agents may use your actions in ways you didn’t intend unless that’s
your goal. Be warned, however, that actions can have consequences.
Safety and security need to be considered. LLMs aren’t going to take
over the world, but they make mistakes and quickly get off track.
Remember, these agents will operate independently and may perform
any action.
WARNING While writing this book and working with and building
agents over many hours, I have encountered several instances of agents
going rogue with actions, from downloading files to writing and
executing code when not intended, continually iterating from tool to
tool, and even deleting files they shouldn’t have. Watching an agent
emerge new behaviors using actions can be fun, but things can quickly
go astray.
For this exercise, we’ll define the goal described in the following listing.
Listing 11.2 Demonstrating planning: The goal
Search Wikipedia for pages on {topic} and download each page and save it
to a file called Wikipedia_{topic}.txt
This goal will demonstrate the following actions:
—Searches Wikipedia and returns page IDs
search_wikipedia(topic)
for the given search term.
—Downloads the page content given
get_wikipedia_page(page_id)
the page ID.
—Saves the content to a file.
save_file
Set the actions on the agent, as shown in figure 11.3. You’ll also want to
make sure the Planner is set to None. We’ll look at setting up and using
planners soon. You don’t have to click Save; the interface automatically
saves an agent’s changes.

Figure 11.3 Selecting the actions for the agent and disabling the planner
After you choose the actions and planner, enter the goal in listing 11.2.
Then click Create New Thread to instantiate a new conversation. Substitute
the topic you want to search for in the chat input, and wait for the agent to
respond. Here’s an example of the goal filled with the topic, but again, use
any topic you like:
Search Wikipedia for pages on Calgary and download each page and save it to
a file called Wikipedia_Calgary.txt.
Figure 11.4 shows the results of submitting the goal to the plain agent. We
see the agent executed the tool/action to search for the topic but couldn’t
execute any steps beyond that. If you recall from our discussion and code
example of actions in chapter 5, OpenAI, Groq, and Azure OpenAI all
support parallel actions but not sequential or planned actions.

## Page 444

Figure 11.4 The results from trying to get the agent/LLM to complete the goal
The LLM can answer reasonably well if you submit a goal with several
parallel tasks/actions. However, if the actions are sequential, requiring one
step to be dependent on another, it will fail. Remember, parallel actions are
standalone actions that can be run alongside others.
Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI Assistants support sequential action
planning. This means both models can be called with sequential plans, and

## Page 445

the model will execute them and return the results. In the next section, we’ll
explore sequential planning and then demonstrate it in action.
11.2 Understanding the sequential planning
process
In the next exercise, we’ll ask an OpenAI assistant to solve the same goal.
If you have Anthropic/Claude credentials and have the engine configured,
you can also try this exercise with that model.
Figure 11.5 shows the difference between executing tasks sequentially
(planning) and using iteration. If you’ve used GPTs, assistants, or Claude
Sonnet 3.5, you’ve likely already experienced this difference. These
advanced tools already incorporate planning by prompt annotations,
advanced training, or combining both.

## Page 446

Figure 11.5 The difference between iterative and planned execution
As LLM and chat services evolve, most models will likely natively support
some form of planning and tool use. However, most models, including
GPT-4o, only support action/tool use today.
Let’s open the GPT Assistants Playground to demonstrate sequential
planning in action. If you need help, refer to the setup guide in chapter 6.

## Page 447

We’ll use the same goal but, this time, run it against an assistant (which has
built-in planning).
After you launch the Playground, create a new assistant, and assign it the
, and actions. Figure
search_ wikipedia, get_wikipedia_page save_file
11.6 shows the results of entering the goal to the assistant. As you can see,
the assistant completed all the tasks behind the scenes and responded with
the user’s final requested output, achieving the goal.

## Page 448

## Page 449

Figure 11.6 The assistant processing the goal and outputting the results
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the OpenAI Assistant’s planner, we
added another task, summarizing each page, to the goal. The inserted task
didn’t have a function/tool, but the assistant was savvy enough to use its
ability to summarize the content. You can see the output of what the
assistant produced by opening the
[root
file and
folder]assistants_working_folder/Wikipedia_{topic}.txt
reviewing the contents. Now that we understand how LLMs function
without planners and planning, we can move on to creating our planners in
the next section.
11.3 Building a sequential planner
LLM tools such as LangChain and Semantic Kernel (SK) have many
planners using various strategies. However, writing our planner is relatively
easy, and Nexus also supports a plugin-style interface allowing you to add
other planners from tools such as LangChain and SK, or your derivatives.
Planners may sound complicated, but they are easily implemented through
prompt engineering strategies that incorporate planning and reasoning. In
chapter 10, we covered the basics of reasoning and deriving plans, and now
we can put those skills to good use.
Listing 11.3 shows a sequential planner derived from the SK, which is
extended to incorporate iteration. Prompt annotation planners like those
shown in the listing can be adapted to fit specific needs or be more general
like those shown. This planner uses JSON, but planners could use any
format an LLM understands, including code.

## Page 450

Listing 11.3 basic_nexus_planner.py
You are a planner for Nexus. #1
Your job is to create a properly formatted JSON plan step by step, to
satisfy the goal given.
Create a list of subtasks based off the [GOAL] provided.
Each subtask must be from within the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] list. Do not
use any functions that are not in the list.
Base your decisions on which functions to use from the description and the
name of the function.
Sometimes, a function may take arguments. Provide them if necessary.
The plan should be as short as possible.
You will also be given a list of corrective, suggestive and epistemic
feedback from previous plans to help you make your decision.
For example:
[SPECIAL FUNCTIONS] #2
for-each- prefix
description: execute a function for each item in a list
args:
- function: the function to execute
- list: the list of items to iterate over
- index: the arg name for the current item in the list
[AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]
GetJokeTopics
description: Get a list ([str]) of joke topics
EmailTo

args:
- text: the text to email
- recipient: the recipient's email address. Multiple addresses may be
included if separated by ';'.

Figure 11.7 shows the process of building and running a planning prompt,
from building to execution to finally returning the results to the user.
Planners work by building a planning prompt, submitting it to an LLM to
construct the plan, parsing and executing the plan locally, returning the
results to an LLM to evaluate and summarize, and finally returning the final
output back to the user.

## Page 452

Figure 11.7 The planning process for creating and executing a plan
It’s essential to notice a few subtle details about the planning process.
Typically, the plan is built in isolation by not adding context history. This is
done to focus on the goal because most planning prompts consume many
tokens. Executing the functions within the executor is usually done in a
local environment and may include calling APIs, executing code, or even
running machine learning models.

## Page 453

Listing 11.4 shows the code for the function from the
create_plan
class; tools such as LangChain and SK use similar
BasicNexusPlanner
patterns. The process loads the agent’s actions as a string. The goal and
available functions list are then inserted into the planner prompt template
using the , which is just a wrapper for the
PromptTemplateManager
template-handling code. Template handling is done with simple regex but
can also be more sophisticated using tools such as Jinja2, Handlebars, or
Mustache.
Listing 11.4 basic_nexus_planner.py (create_plan)
def create_plan(self, nexus, agent, goal: str, prompt: str = PROMPT) -> Plan:
selected_actions = nexus.get_actions(agent.actions)
available_functions_string = "\n\n".join(
format_action(action) for action in selected_actions
) #1
context = {} #2
context["goal"] = goal
context["available_functions"] = available_functions_string
ptm = PromptTemplateManager() #3
prompt = ptm.render_prompt(prompt, context)
plan_text = nexus.execute_prompt(agent, prompt) #4
return Plan(prompt=prompt,
goal=goal,
plan_text=plan_text) #5
#1 Loads the agent’s available actions and formats the result string for the planner
#2 The context will be injected into the planner prompt template.
#3 A simple template manager, similar in concept to Jinja2, Handlebars, or Mustache
#4 Sends the filled-in planner prompt to the LLM
#5 The results (the plan) are wrapped in a Plan class and returned for execution.
The code to execute the plan, shown in listing 11.5, parses the JSON string
and executes the functions. When executing the plan, the code detects the
particular function, which iterates through a list and executes
for-each
each element in a function. The results of each function execution are added
to the context. This context is passed to each function call and returned as
the final output.

## Page 454

Listing 11.5 basic_nexus_planner.py (execute_plan)
def execute_plan(self, nexus, agent, plan: Plan) -> str:
context = {}
plan = plan.generated_plan
for task in plan["subtasks"]: #1
if task["function"] == "for-each": #2
list_name = task["args"]["list"]
index_name = task["args"]["index"]
inner_task = task["args"]["function"]
list_value = context.get(list_name, [])
for item in list_value:
context[index_name] = item
result = nexus.execute_task(agent, inner_task, context)
context[f"for-each_{list_name}_{item}"] = result
for_each_output = [ #2
context[f"for-each_{list_name}_{item}"] ↪
for item in list_value
]
context[f"for-each_{list_name}"] = for_each_output
for item in list_value: #3
del context[f"for-each_{list_name}_{item}"]
else:
result = nexus.execute_task(agent,
task,
context) #4
context[f"output_{task['function']}"] = result
return context #5
#1 Iterates through each subtask in the plan
#2 Handles functions that should be iterated over and adds full list of results to the context
#3 Removes individual for-each context entries
#4 General task execution
#5 Returns the full context, which includes the results of each function call
The returned context from the entire execution is sent in a final call to the
LLM, which summarizes the results and returns a response. If everything
goes as planned, the LLM will respond with a summary of the results. If
there is an error or something is missing, the LLM may try to fix the
problem or inform the user of the error.
Let’s now open Nexus again and test a planner in operation. Load up the
same agent you used last time, but select the planner under the Advanced
options this time, as shown in figure 11.8. Then, enter the goal prompt as
you did before, and let the agent take it away.

## Page 455

Figure 11.8 The results from requesting to complete the goal in Nexus using the basic planner
After a few minutes, the agent returns with the saved file, and in some
cases, it may provide extra information, such as the next steps and what to

## Page 456

do with the output. This is because the agent was given a high-level
overview of what it accomplished. Remember, though, that plan execution
is done at the local level, and only context, plan, and goal were sent to the
LLM.
This means that plan execution can be completed by any process, not
necessarily by the agent. Executing a plan outside the LLM reduces the
tokens and tool use the agent needs to perform. This also means that an
LLM doesn’t need to support tools usage to use a planner.
Internally, when a planner is enabled within Nexus, the agent engine tool is
bypassed. Instead, the planner completes the action execution, and the agent
is only aware of the actions through the passing of the output context. This
can be good for models that support tool use but can’t plan. However, a
planner may limit functionality for models that support both tool use and
planning, such as Claude.
In general, you’ll want to understand the capabilities of the LLM you’re
using. If you’re unsure of those details, then a little trial and error can also
work. Ask the agent to complete a multistep goal with and without planning
enabled, and then see the results.
Planning allows agents to complete multiple sequential tasks to achieve
more complex goals. The problem with external or prompt planning is that
it bypasses the feedback iteration loop, which can help correct problems
quickly. Because of this, OpenAI and others are now directly integrating
reasoning and planning at the LLM level, as we’ll see in the next section.
11.4 Reviewing a stepwise planner: OpenAI
Strawberry
The release of the o1-preview model, code named Strawberry, introduced a
dramatic shift in the type of LLMs becoming available for agentic systems.
Strawberry was not only proclaimed to be more efficient at math, science,
and general calculation tasks but also able to engage in reasoning, planning,
evaluation, and feedback directly in the LLM.

## Page 457

Consider our time travel problem from chapter 10 and shown again in
figure 11.9. If you recall, this problem was difficult to solve using GPT-4
and other similar LLMs. However, with the application of reasoning and
feedback, we were able to produce output that was occasionally correct.
Figure 11.9 The time travel problem, revisited
As an experiment, enter this problem into ChatGPT using the o1-preview
model, as shown in listing 11.6. Sit back for a few seconds and wait for the
answer. Yep, the model still gets it wrong.

## Page 458

Listing 11.6 Time travel reasoning/planning problem
In a sci-fi film, Alex is a time traveler who decides to go back in time
to witness a famous historical battle that took place 100 years ago,
which lasted for 10 days. He arrives three days before the battle starts.
However, after spending six days in the past, he jumps forward in time
by 50 years and stays there for 20 days. Then, he travels back to
witness the end of the battle. How many days does Alex spend in the past
before he sees the end of the battle?
While it may be somewhat disappointing to see the model get the wrong
answer, it does, however, do a far better job of breaking down the problem
and demonstrating its answer. Listing 11.7 shows the sample output from
posing the problem in listing 11.6 to the Strawberry model. Note, you may
get a different answer because of the stochastic nature of the LLM.
Listing 11.7 o1-preview response to time travel problem
To determine how many days Alex spends in the past before witnessing the
end of the battle, let's reconstruct the timeline step by step:
Arrival in the Past:
Alex arrives 3 days before the battle begins.
He spends these 3 days waiting for the battle to start.
During the Battle:
The battle starts, and Alex experiences the first 3 days of it.
At this point, he has spent a total of 6 days in the past (3 days before
the battle and 3 days during the battle).
Time Jump Forward: #1
After these 6 days, Alex jumps 50 years forward in time.
He spends 20 days in this future time.
Return to the Past:
Alex then returns to the past to witness the end of the battle.
Since the battle lasts 10 days and he left after day 3 of the battle,
there are 7 days remaining in the battle.
However, because he was away for 20 days, which is longer than the
remaining 7 days of the battle, he must return to a point in time before
the battle ends to witness its conclusion.
To see the end of the battle, he returns to the past on the last day of
the battle.
Final Days Spent Before the Battle Ends:
Upon returning, he spends 1 more day in the past to witness the battle's
end.
Total Days Spent in the Past Before Seeing the End:
6 days before jumping forward in time.
1 day after returning to the past.
Total: 6 + 1 = 7 days.
Answer: 7
#1 It becomes obvious where the model is making the error.
Because we know the right answer is 27, we know the LLM is wrong, but if
we didn’t, we could just as easily assume that the work and reasoning were
all correct. Problems like this can happen when we remove feedback in

## Page 459

LLM interactions and agentic systems. Feedback can guide the model to
correct itself.
However, what if we didn’t know the correct answer was 27 (26, if you
assume he doesn’t spend the day to witness the battle) and assumed the
LLM or agent was correct? Well, this is a problem we can rectify with a
couple of simple prompts that can engage the LLM in reasoning and
planning feedback. However, these techniques are more effective with
LLMs or wrappers such as the OpenAI Assistants, which provide reasoning
and planning within the model.
What we want to do is provide feedback to the LLM, but understanding
what that feedback is will likely be difficult for us. Fortunately, we can
elicit feedback directly from the LLM, provided we give the correct answer.
Listing 11.8 shows how to generate constructive feedback from the LLM
concerning our time travel problem.
Listing 11.8 Generating feedback
the correct answer is 27, please review what you did wrong and suggest
feedback you could give yourself when trying to solve similar future problems
Entering this after the model answers the question wrong will generate
feedback that you can use to guide the model through prompting or as part
of system instructions. Listing 11.9 shows an example of the feedback
provided by o1-preview. You can then extract this feedback and augment
the instructions the next time you want to tackle complex time travel
problems.

## Page 460

Listing 11.9 Generated feedback
Feedback for Future Problems
Understanding Time Frames in Time Travel:
Relative Time Frames: Always consider the time periods relative to the
original point of reference. In this problem, even though Alex jumps
forward 50 years, he is still in the past relative to his original
present time.
Including All Relevant Periods:
Ensure that all time periods spent in the past (or future) are included
in the total calculation, even if they involve moving to different
points in time.
Time Continuity:
Remember that while the traveler moves through time, events in other
time periods continue to progress unless specified otherwise.
Application:
Careful Reading:
Pay close attention to the details provided, such as the durations and
the sequences of time jumps.
Visualization:
It may help to draw a timeline to visualize the sequence of events and
time periods involved.
Double-Checking Calculations:
After solving, revisit each step to ensure all time periods are
accounted for correctly.
This feedback technique will consistently work on models such as o1-
preview, but other models may still struggle to answer correctly, even given
this feedback. Over time, as models become smarter, this technique will
likely generally work on most models. However, this feedback mechanism
will likely be essential even as models get progressively brighter. because
language is nuanced, and not every problem we challenge LLMs with may
have an obvious absolute answer. Take our example problem, for instance.
This problem is an excellent example of requiring the problem solver to
make assumptions and draw correlations from the question. There are still
plenty of areas in science, from geology to behavioral science, where
answering the same problem may yield a range of answers. Let’s look next
at a few techniques for how the application of reasoning, planning,
evaluation, and feedback can be applied to agentic systems.
11.5 Applying planning, reasoning, evaluation,
and feedback to assistant and agentic systems
In recent chapters, we’ve examined how the agentic components of
planning, reasoning, feedback, and evaluation can be implemented. Now we
look at how, when, and where those components can be integrated into

## Page 461

assistant and agentic systems for real-time production, research, or
development.
While not all of these components may fit the same into every application,
it’s useful to understand where and when to apply which component. In the
next section, we look at how planning can be integrated into
assistant/agentic systems.
11.5.1 Application of assistant/agentic planning
Planning is the component where an assistant or agent can plan to undertake
a set of tasks, whether they are in series, parallel, or some other
combination. We typically associate planning with tool use, and, rightfully,
any system using tools will likely want a capable planner. However, not all
systems are created equally, so in table 11.1, we’ll review where, when, and
how to implement planners.

Table 11.1 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find
an assistant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further
information and guidance, this list provides more details about how
planning may be employed in each application:
Personal assistant—While this application has been slow to roll out,
LLM personal assistants promise to surpass Alexa and Siri in the future.
Planning will be essential to these new assistants/agents to coordinate
numerous complex tasks and execute tools (actions) in series or parallel.
Customer service bot—Due to the controlled nature of this environment,
it’s unlikely that assistants engaged directly with customers will have
controlled and very specific tools use. This means that these types of
assistants will likely not require extensive planning.

## Page 463

Autonomous agent—As we’ve seen in previous chapters, agents with the
ability to plan can complete a series of complex tasks for various goals.
Planning will be an essential element of any autonomous agentic
system.
Collaborative workflows—Think of these as agents or assistants that sit
alongside coders or writers. While these workflows are still in early
development, think of a workflow where agents are automatically tasked
with writing and executing test code alongside developers. Planning will
be an essential part of executing these complex future workflows.
Game AI—While applying LLMs to games is still in early stages, it isn’t
hard to imagine in-game agents or assistants that can assist or challenge
the player. Giving these agents the ability to plan and execute complex
workflows could disrupt how and with whom we play games.
Research—Similar to collaborative workflows, these agents will be
responsible for deriving new ideas from existing sources of information.
Finding that information will likely be facilitated through extensive tool
use, which will benefit from coordination of planning.
As you can see, planning is an essential part of many LLM applications,
whether through coordination of tool use or otherwise. In the next section,
we look at the next component of reasoning and how it can be applied to the
same application stack.
11.5.2 Application of assistant/agentic reasoning
Reasoning, while often strongly associated with planning and task
completion, is a component that can also stand by itself. As LLMs mature
and get smarter, reasoning is often included within the LLM itself.
However, not all applications may benefit from extensive reasoning, as it
often introduces a thinking cycle within the LLM response. Table 11.2
describes at a high level how the reasoning component can be integrated
with various LLM application types.

Table 11.2 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find
an assistant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further
information and guidance, this list provides more details about how
reasoning may be employed in each application:
Personal assistant—Depending on the application, the amount of
reasoning an agent employs may be limited. Reasoning is a process that
requires the LLM to think through a problem, and this often requires
longer response times depending on the complexity of the problem and
the extent of the prompt. In many situations, responses intended to be

## Page 465

closer to real-time reasoning may be disabled or turned down. While this
may limit the complexity at which an agent can interact, limited or no
reasoning can improve response times and increase user enjoyment.
Customer service bot—Again, because of the controlled nature of this
environment, it’s unlikely that assistants engaged directly with
customers will need to perform complex or any form of reasoning.
Autonomous agent—While reasoning is a strong component of
autonomous agents, we still don’t know how much reasoning is too
much. As models such as Strawberry become available for agentic
workflows, we can gauge at what point extensive reasoning may not be
needed. This will surely be the case for well-defined autonomous agent
workflows.
Collaborative workflows—Again, applying reasoning creates an
overhead in the LLM interaction. Extensive reasoning may provide
benefits for some workflows, while other well-defined workflows may
suffer. This may mean that these types of workflows will benefit from
multiple agents—those with reasoning and those without.
Game AI—Similar to other applications, heavy-reasoning applications
may not be appropriate for most game AIs. Games will especially
require LLM response times to be quick, and this will surely be the
application of reasoning for general tactical agents. Of course, that
doesn’t preclude the use of other reasoning agents that may provide
more strategic control.
Research—Reasoning will likely be essential to any complex research
task for several reasons. A good example is the application of the
Strawberry model, which we’ve already seen in research done in
mathematics and the sciences.
While we often consider reasoning in tandem with planning, there may be
conditions where the level at which each is implemented may differ. In the
next section we consider the agent pillar of evaluation of various
applications.
11.5.3 Application of evaluation to agentic systems
Evaluation is the component of agentic/assistant systems that can guide
how well the system performs. While we demonstrated incorporating

## Page 466

evaluation in some agentic workflows, evaluation is often an external
component in agentic systems. However, it’s also a core component of most
LLM applications and not something that should be overlooked in most
developments. Table 11.3 describes at a high level how the evaluation
component can be integrated with various LLM application types.

Table 11.3 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find
an assistant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further
information and guidance, this list provides more details about how
evaluation may be employed in each application:

## Page 467

Personal assistant—In most cases, an evaluation component will be
used to process and guide the performance of agent responses. In
systems primarily employing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for
document exploration, the evaluation indicates how well the assistant
responds to information requests.
Customer service bot—Evaluating service bots is critical to
understanding how well the bot responds to customer requests. In many
cases, a strong RAG knowledge element may be an element of the
system that will require extensive and ongoing evaluation. Again, with
most evaluation components, this element is external to the main
working system and is often run as part of monitoring general
performance over several metrics.
Autonomous agent—In most cases, a manual review of agent output will
be a primary guide to the success of an autonomous agent. However, in
some cases, internal evaluation can help guide the agent when it’s
undertaking complex tasks or as a means of improving the final output.
Multiple agent systems, such as CrewAI and AutoGen, are examples of
autonomous agents that use internal feedback to improve the generated
output.
Collaborative workflows—In most direct cases, manual evaluation is
ongoing within these types of workflows. A user will often immediately
and in near real time correct the assistant/agent by evaluating the output.
Additional agents could be added similarly to autonomous agents for
more extensive collaborative workflows.
Game AI—Evaluation will often be broken down into development
evaluation—evaluating how the agent interacts with the game—and in-
game evaluation, evaluating how well an agent succeeded at a task.
Implementing the later evaluation form is similar to autonomous agents
but aims to improve some strategies or execution. Such in-game
evaluations would also likely benefit from memory and a means of
feedback.
Research—Evaluation at this level generally occurs as a manual effort
after completing the research task. An agent could employ some form of
evaluation similar to autonomous agents to improve the generated
output, perhaps even contemplating internally how evaluation of the
output could be extended or further researched. Because this is currently

## Page 468

a new area for agentic development, how well this will be executed
remains to be seen.
Evaluation is an essential element to any agentic or assistant system,
especially if that system provides real and fundamental information to
users. Developing evaluation systems for agents and assistants is likely
something that could or should have its own book. In the final section of
this chapter, we’ll look at feedback implementation for various LLM
applications.
11.5.4 Application of feedback to agentic/assistant applications
Feedback as a component of agentic systems is often, if not always,
implemented as an external component—at least for now. Perhaps
confidence in evaluation systems may improve to the point where feedback
is regularly incorporated into such systems. Table 11.4 showcases how
feedback can be implemented into various LLM applications.

Table 11.4 shows several application scenarios in which we may find an
assistant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further
information and guidance, this list provides more details about how
feedback may be employed in each application:
Personal assistant—If the assistant or agent interacts with the user in a
chat-style interface, direct and immediate feedback can be applied by the
user. Whether this feedback is sustained over future conversations or
interactions, it usually develops within agentic memory. Assistants such

## Page 470

as ChatGPT now incorporate memory and can benefit from explicit user
feedback.
Customer service bot—User or system feedback is typically provided
through a survey after the interaction has completed. This usually means
that feedback is regulated to an external system that aggregates the
feedback for later improvements.
Autonomous agent—Much like bots, feedback within autonomous
agents is typically regulated to after the agent has completed a task that a
user then reviews. The feedback mechanism may be harder to capture
because many things can be subjective. Methods explored in this chapter
for producing feedback can be used within prompt engineering
improvements.
Collaborative workflows—Similar to the personal assistant, these types
of applications can benefit from immediate and direct feedback from the
user. Again, how this information is persisted across sessions is often an
implementation of agentic memory.
Game AI—Feedback can be implemented alongside evaluation through
additional and multiple agents. This feedback form may again be single-
use and exist within the current interaction or may persist as memory.
Imagine a game AI that can evaluate its actions, improve those with
feedback, and remember those improvements. While this pattern isn’t
ideal for games, it will certainly improve the gameplay experience.
Research—Similar to evaluation in the context of research, feedback is
typically performed offline after the output is evaluated. While some
development has been done using multiple agent systems incorporating
agents for evaluation and feedback, these systems don’t always perform
well, at least not with the current state-of-the-art models. Instead, it’s
often better to isolate feedback and evaluation at the end to avoid the
common feedback looping problem.
Feedback is another powerful component of agentic and assistant systems,
but it’s not always required on the first release. However, incorporating
rigorous feedback and evaluation mechanisms can greatly benefit agentic
systems in the long term concerning ongoing monitoring and providing the
confidence to improve various aspects of the system.

## Page 471

How you implement each of these components in your agentic systems
may, in part, be guided by the architecture of your chosen agentic platform.
Now that you understand the nuances of each component, you also have the
knowledge to guide you in selecting the right agent system that fits your
application and business use case. Regardless of your application, you’ll
want to employ several agentic components in almost all cases.
As agentic systems mature and LLMs themselves get smarter, some of the
components we today consider external may be closely integrated. We’ve
already seen reasoning and planning be integrated into a model such as
Strawberry. Certainly, as we approach the theoretical artificial general
intelligence milestone, we may see models capable of performing long-term
self-evaluation and feedback.
In any case, I hope you enjoyed this journey with me into this incredible
frontier of a new and emerging technology that will certainly alter our
perception of work and how we undertake it through agents.
11.6 Exercises
Use the following exercises to improve your knowledge of the material:
Exercise 1—Implement a Simple Planning Agent (Beginner)
Objective —Learn how to implement a basic planning agent using a prompt
to generate a sequence of actions.
Tasks:
Create an agent that receives a goal, breaks it into steps, and executes
those steps sequentially.
Define a simple goal, such as retrieving information from Wikipedia
and saving it to a file.
Implement the agent using a basic planner prompt (refer to the planner
example in section 11.3).
Run the agent, and evaluate how well it plans and executes each step.

## Page 472

Exercise 2—Test Feedback Integration in a Planning Agent
(Intermediate)
Objective —Understand how feedback mechanisms can improve the
performance of an agentic system.
Tasks:
Modify the agent from exercise 1 to include a feedback loop after each
task.
Use the feedback to adjust or correct the next task in the sequence.
Test the agent by giving it a more complex task, such as gathering data
from multiple sources, and observe how the feedback improves its
performance.
Document and compare the agent’s behavior before and after adding
feedback.
Exercise 3—Experiment with Parallel and Sequential Planning
(Intermediate)
Objective—Learn the difference between parallel and sequential actions
and how they affect agent behavior.
Tasks:
Set up two agents using Nexus: one that executes tasks in parallel and
another that performs tasks sequentially.
Define a multistep goal where some actions depend on the results of
previous actions (sequential), and some can be done simultaneously
(parallel).
Compare the performance and output of both agents, noting any errors
or inefficiencies in parallel execution when sequential steps are
required.
Exercise 4—Build and Integrate a Custom Planner into Nexus
(Advanced)
Objective —Learn how to build a custom planner and integrate it into an
agent platform.

## Page 473

Tasks:
Write a custom planner using prompt engineering strategies from
section 11.3, ensuring it supports sequential task execution.
Integrate this planner into Nexus, and create an agent that uses it.
Test the planner with a complex goal that involves multiple steps and
tools (e.g., data retrieval, processing, and saving).
Evaluate how the custom planner performs compared to built-in
planners in Nexus or other platforms.
Exercise 5—Implement Error Handling and Feedback in Sequential
Planning (Advanced)
Objective —Learn how to implement error handling and feedback to refine
sequential planning in an agentic system.
Tasks:
Using a sequential planner, set up an agent to perform a goal that may
encounter common errors (e.g., a failed API call, missing data, or
invalid input).
Implement error-handling mechanisms in the planner to recognize and
respond to these errors.
Add feedback loops to adjust the plan or retry actions based on the
error encountered.
Test the system by deliberately causing errors during execution, and
observe how the agent recovers or adjusts its plan.
Summary
Planning is central to agents and assistants, allowing them to take a goal,
break it into steps, and execute them. Without planning, agents are
reduced to simple chatbot-like interactions.
Agents must differentiate between parallel and sequential actions. Many
LLMs can handle parallel actions, but only advanced models support
sequential planning, critical for complex task completion.

## Page 474

Feedback is crucial in guiding agents to correct their course and improve
performance over time. This chapter demonstrates how feedback
mechanisms can be integrated with agents to refine their decision-
making processes.
Platforms such as OpenAI Assistants and Anthropic’s Claude support
internal planning and can execute complex, multistep tasks. Agents
using these platforms can use sequential action planning for
sophisticated workflows.
Properly selecting and limiting agent actions is vital to avoid confusion
and unintended behavior. Too many actions may overwhelm an agent,
while unnecessary tools may be misused.
Nexus allows for creating and managing agents through a flexible
interface, where users can implement custom planners, set goals, and
assign tools. The chapter includes practical examples using Nexus to
highlight the difference between a raw LLM and a planner-enhanced
agent.
Writing custom planners is straightforward, using prompt engineering
strategies. Tools such as LangChain and Semantic Kernel offer a variety
of planners that can be adapted or extended to fit specific agentic needs.
Models such as OpenAI Strawberry integrate reasoning, planning,
evaluation, and feedback directly into the LLM, offering more accurate
problem-solving capabilities.
Evaluation helps determine how well an agentic system is performing
and can be implemented internally or externally, depending on the use
case.
As LLMs evolve, reasoning, planning, and feedback mechanisms may
become deeply integrated into models, paving the way for more
autonomous and intelligent agent systems.

appendix A Accessing OpenAI
large language models
Although several commercial large language model (LLM) services are
available, this book recommends using OpenAI services directly or
through Azure OpenAI Studio. To access either service, you must create an
account and register a payment method not covered in this appendix. The
GPT-4 family of LLMs is considered best in class and better suited for
agent development. Using open source and alternative services is always
an option but generally only advisable after you’ve worked with GPT-4 for
some time.
A.1 Accessing OpenAI accounts and keys
The following general steps can help you quickly set up using OpenAI
LLMs for agent development. Though using OpenAI and other commercial
LLMs comes at a price, you can expect to pay less than US$100 to
complete all the exercises in this book:
1. Go to https://openai.com and log in, or register for an account and log
in. If this is your first time creating an account, you’ll likely be given
free credit in some amount. If you already have an account, you must
register a payment method and type. It’s generally better to purchase a
number of credits at a time. This will allow you to manage the costs
better and avoid overruns.
2. After logging in to the platform, select ChatGPT or the API, as shown
in figure A.1. Choose the API.

## Page 476

Figure A.1 Selecting the API section of the OpenAI platform
3. Open the left menu, and select the API Keys option, as shown in figure
A.2.

## Page 477

Figure A.2 Selecting the API Keys option
4. Click the Create button to create a new key, enter a name for the key,
and click the Create Secret Key button, as shown in figure A.3.

## Page 478

Figure A.3 Creating the secret API key
5. Copy and paste the key to a notepad or another area for safekeeping
using the Copy button, as shown in figure A.4. Keep this key secret,
and ensure it remains only on your development machine.

## Page 479

Figure A.4 Copying and pasting the key to a well-known safe location
After generating a key, you can continue to use it within an
.env
configuration file or through other means of registering an OpenAI key.
For most of the packages used in this book, configuring OpenAI will
generally only require the key. Other services, such as Azure OpenAI, will
require the configuration of a model deployment and a base URL as
covered in the next section.
A.2 Azure OpenAI Studio, keys, and deployments
Through its ongoing relationship with OpenAI, Microsoft hosts the same
models at the same price within Azure OpenAI Studio. Occasionally, Azure
may be a model version behind, but Microsoft generally keeps current with
the latest OpenAI models.
These guidelines will be more general because there are several ways to
access Azure and methods of creating accounts and accessing the studio
(for specific instructions, refer to Microsoft documentation):
1. Log in to your Azure portal account subscription.

## Page 480

2. Create a new Azure OpenAI Studio resource in a region that makes
sense to you. At the time of writing, not all regions provided access to
all models. You may need to check which models are available for your
region first. This will also be specific to your account and usage.
Within Azure OpenAI, models are exposed through a resource allocation
called a deployment. Deployments wrap a model, such as GPT-4, and
provide access to the resource. Figure A.5 shows an example of various
models being exposed through deployments.

## Page 481

Figure A.5 Deploying a model through an Azure OpenAI Studio deployment
3. Click the Create New Deployment button to create a new deployment,
and then select the model you want to deploy.
4. After the model is wrapped in a deployment, you must access the
parent Azure OpenAI resource. From there, you can access the key,
endpoint, or base URL needed to configure your connection, as shown
in figure A.6.

## Page 482

Figure A.6 Getting access to the keys and base URL used to access the service
Again, if you get stuck, the Microsoft documentation can guide you in the
right direction. The three critical differences to remember when connecting

## Page 483

to a resource such as Azure OpenAI Studio or another LLM using the
OpenAI tooling are listed here:
The to access the model
api key
The base or where the model is located
url endpoint
The name of the or name
model deployment
If you can’t access a model for whatever reason, a good alternative is open
source models. Setting up and consuming open source LLMs is covered in
chapter 2.

appendix B Python development
environment
While this book assumes readers are experienced Python developers, this
could mean many different things. In this appendix, we look at configuring
a Python development environment that will function with the code
examples in this book. You can use other integrated development
environments (IDEs), but not all tooling, especially extensions, will work
in all IDEs.
B.1 Downloading the source code
To download and run the source code, install Git, and then pull the
repository locally. Here are the high-level steps to pull the code from the
book’s GitHub repository:
1. Install Git if you need to. Git can be installed from multiple sources, but
a good option is the main release, found here: https://git-
scm.com/downloads. Follow the instructions to download and install
the tool for your operating system.
2. Open a terminal in a folder you want to download the source to, and
then enter the following command:
git clone https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/GPT-Agents.git
3. After the code is downloaded, you can begin by opening the chapter
folder that you’re working on in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). If you
need to install VS Code or understand how to load a chapter folder as a
workspace, consult section B.5 in this appendix.

## Page 485

B.2 Installing Python
Python is provided through different versions and deployments. This book
relies on the standard Python installation, version 3.10. Anaconda is
another deployment of Python that is very popular and could be used.
However, all the material in this book has been run and tested with a
Python 3.10 virtual environment:
1. Go to www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Locate and download the latest release of Python 3.10 for your
operating system.
3. Install the release on your machine using the instructions for your
operating system.
4. To confirm your installation, open a terminal, and execute the following
command:
python –-version
The version should be 3.10, but if it isn’t, don't worry. You may have
multiple Python versions installed. We’ll also confirm the installation when
setting up VS Code.
B.3 Installing VS Code
Installing VS Code is relatively straightforward and can be done in just a
few steps:
1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com.
2. Download a stable release of VS Code for your operating system.
3. After the release is downloaded, follow the installation instructions for
your operating system.
4. Launch VS Code for your operating system, and make sure no warnings
or errors appear. If you encounter problems, try to restart your computer
and/or reinstall.

## Page 486

With VS Code running, we can install the necessary extensions. We’ll
cover those extensions next.
B.4 Installing VS Code Python extensions
Thousands of extensions for VS Code can provide an excellent Python
coding environment. The recommended ones are only the start of what you
can explore independently. Beware, though, that not all extensions are
created equally. When installing new extensions, look at the number of
installs and ratings. Extensions with fewer than four stars are generally to
be avoided. To install the extensions, follow these steps:
1. Launch VS Code, and open the Extensions panel, as shown in figure
B.1.

## Page 487

Figure B.1 Installing VS Code extensions
2. Install the following list of extensions:
Python, for environment and language support
Python Extension Pack, for covering other extensions
Python Environment Manager, for managing environments
Python Indent, for code formatting
Flake8, for code formatting/linting
Prompt Flow, for testing LLM prompts
Semantic Kernel Tools, for working with the Semantic Kernel
framework

## Page 488

Docker, for managing Docker containers
Dev Containers, for running development environments with
containers
You’ll only need to install the extensions for each VS Code environment
you’re running. Typically, this will mean installing for just your operating
system installation of VS Code. However, if you run VS Code in
containers, you must install extensions for each container you’re running.
Working with Python in the Dev Containers extension will be covered later
in this appendix.
B.5 Creating a new Python environment with VS
Code
When developing Python projects, you often want to create isolated virtual
environments. This will help in managing multiple package dependencies
across various tasks and tools. In this book, it’s recommended that a new
virtual environment be created for each new chapter. VS Code can help
you create and manage multiple Python environments quickly and
efficiently via the following steps:
1. Press Ctrl-Shift-P (Cmd-Shift-P) to open the command panel, and select
Python: Create Environment, as shown in figure B.2.

## Page 489

Figure B.2 The steps to set up the virtual environment for a chapter

## Page 490

2. Select the environment type, either Venv or Conda. This book
demonstrates Venv but Conda should also work.
3. Select the Python installation. The code in this book has been run with
Python 3.10 at a minimum. The agent tools and frameworks featured in
this book are cutting edge, so they should support later versions of
Python.
4. Check that the file in the chapter folder is selected.
requirements.txt
This will install all the requirements for the current chapter.
You should complete these steps for each new chapter of the book. The
alternative is to use VS Code development containers, which will be
covered in the next section.
B.6 Using VS Code Dev Containers (Docker)
When working with advanced agents and agents that can generate and
execute code, running them in isolated containers is generally
recommended. Container isolation prevents operating system disruption or
corruption and provides a base for deploying agents.
Getting familiar with containers and platforms such as Docker can be an
extensive undertaking to grasp everything. Fortunately, it takes very little
knowledge to start using containers, and VS Code extensions make this
even more accessible.
You’ll first need to install a container toolset. Docker is free (provided you
use the tool as a hobby or you’re a student) and the most accessible.
Follow these instructions to install Docker and get started working with
containers:
1. Go to the Docker Desktop download page at
www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.
2. Download and install Docker for your operating system. Follow any
other instructions as requested.
3. Launch the Docker desktop application. Completing this step will
confirm you have Docker installed and working as expected.

## Page 491

4. Open VS Code, and confirm that the Docker extensions listed in section
1.4 are installed.
With Docker and VS Code configured, you can move on to using Dev
Containers by following these steps:
1. Open a new instance of VS Code.
2. Select to open a remote window, as shown in figure B.3.

## Page 492

[No extractable text]

## Page 493

Figure B.3 Opening a remote window to a container in VS Code
3. Select Open Folder in Container to start a container from a folder, or
select New Dev Container to start without a folder.
After the container is launched, your VS Code environment will be
connected. This allows you to develop code on the container without
worrying about dependencies not working.
