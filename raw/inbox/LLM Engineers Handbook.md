Forewords
As my co-founder at Hugging Face, Clement Delangue, and I often
say, AI is becoming the default way of building technology.
Over the past 3 years, LLMs have already had a profound impact on
technology, and they are bound to have an even greater impact in
the coming 5 years. They will be embedded in more and more
products and, I believe, at the center of any human activity based on
knowledge or creativity.
For instance, coders are already leveraging LLMs and changing the
way they work, focusing on higher-order thinking and tasks while
collaborating with machines. Studio musicians rely on AI-powered
tools to explore the musical creativity space faster. Lawyers are
increasing their impact through retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and large databases of case law.
At Hugging Face, we’ve always advocated for a future where not just
one company or a small number of scientists control the AI models
used by the rest of the population, but instead for a future where as
many people as possible—from as many different backgrounds as
possible—are capable of diving into how cutting-edge machine
learning models actually work.

Maxime Labonne and Paul Iusztin have been instrumental in this
movement to democratize LLMs by writing this book and making
sure that as many people as possible can not only use them but also
adapt them, fine-tune them, quantize them, and make them efficient
enough to actually deploy in the real world.
Their work is essential, and I’m glad they are making this resource
available to the community. This expands the convex hull of human
knowledge.

Preface
The field of LLM engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical area
in artificial intelligence and machine learning. As LLMs continue to
revolutionize natural language processing and generation, the
demand for professionals who can effectively implement, optimize,
and deploy these models in real-world scenarios has grown
exponentially. LLM engineering encompasses a wide range of
disciplines, from data preparation and model fine-tuning to inference
optimization and production deployment, requiring a unique blend of
software engineering, machine learning expertise, and domain
knowledge.
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) plays a crucial role in the
successful implementation of LLMs in production environments.
MLOps extends the principles of DevOps to machine learning
projects, focusing on automating and streamlining the entire ML
lifecycle. For LLMs, MLOps is particularly important due to the
complexity and scale of these models. It addresses challenges such
as managing large datasets, handling model versioning, ensuring
reproducibility, and maintaining model performance over time. By
incorporating MLOps practices, LLM projects can achieve greater
efficiency, reliability, and scalability, ultimately leading to more
successful and impactful deployments.

## Page 16

The LLM Engineer’s Handbook is a comprehensive guide to
applying best practices to the new field of LLM engineering.
Throughout the chapters, readers will find simplified key concepts,
practical techniques, and experts tips for every stage of the LLM
lifecycle. The book covers topics such as data engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, model evaluation, inference optimization, and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline development.
To illustrate these concepts in action, an end-to-end project called
the LLM Twin will be developed throughout the book., with the goal
of imitating someone’s writing style and personality. This use case
will demonstrate how to build a minimum viable product to solve a
specific problem, using various aspects of LLM engineering and
MLOps.
Readers can expect to gain a deeper understanding of how to collect
and prepare data for LLMs, fine-tune models for specific tasks,
optimize inference performance, and implement RAG pipelines.
They will learn how to evaluate LLM performance, align models with
human preferences, and deploy LLM-based applications. The book
also covers essential MLOps principles and practices, enabling
readers to build scalable, reproducible, and robust LLM applications.

What this book covers
Chapter 1, Understanding the LLM Twin Concept and Architecture,
introduces the LLM Twin project, which is used throughout the book
as an end-to-end example of a production-level LLM application, and
defines the FTI architecture for building scalable ML systems and
applies it to the LLM Twin use case.
Chapter 2, Tooling and Installation, presents Python, MLOps, and
cloud tools used to build real-world LLM applications, such as an
orchestrator, experiment tracker, prompt monitoring and LLM
evaluation tool. It shows how to use and install them locally for
testing and development.
Chapter 3, Data Engineering, shows the implementation of a data
collection pipeline that scrapes multiple sites, such as Medium,
GitHub and Substack and stores the raw data in a data warehouse.
It emphasizes collecting raw data from dynamic sources over static
datasets for real-world ML applications.
Chapter 4, RAG Feature Pipeline, introduces RAG fundamental
concepts, such as embeddings, the vanilla RAG framework, vector
databases, and how to optimize RAG applications. It applies the
RAG theory by architecting and implementing LLM Twin’s RAG
feature pipeline using software best practices.

## Page 19

Chapter 5, Supervised Fine-Tuning, explores the process of refining
pre-trained language models for specific tasks using instruction-
answer pairs. It covers creating high-quality datasets, implementing
fine-tuning techniques like full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA, and
provides a practical demonstration of fine-tuning a Llama 3.1 8B
model on a custom dataset.
Chapter 6, Fine-Tuning with Preference Alignment, introduces
techniques for aligning language models with human preferences,
focusing on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). It covers
creating custom preference datasets, implementing DPO, and
provides a practical demonstration of aligning the TwinLlama-3.1-8B
model using the Unsloth library.
Chapter 7, Evaluating LLMs, details various methods for assessing
the performance of language models and LLM systems. It introduces
general-purpose and domain-specific evaluations and discusses
popular benchmarks. The chapter includes a practical evaluation of
the TwinLlama-3.1-8B model using multiple criteria.
Chapter 8, Inference Optimization, covers key optimization strategies
such as speculative decoding, model parallelism, and weight
quantization. It discusses how to improve inference speed, reduce
latency, and minimize memory usage, introducing popular inference
engines and comparing their features.

## Page 20

Chapter 9, RAG Inference Pipeline, explores advanced RAG
techniques by implementing methods such as self-query, reranking,
and filtered vector search from scratch. It covers designing and
implementing the LLM Twin’s RAG inference pipeline and a custom
retrieval module similar to what you see in popular frameworks such
as LangChain.
Chapter 10, Inference Pipeline Deployment, introduces ML
deployment strategies, such as online, asynchronous and batch
inference, which will help in architecting and deploying the LLM Twin
fine-tuned model to AWS SageMaker and building a FastAPI
microservice to expose the RAG inference pipeline as a RESTful
API.
Chapter 11, MLOps and LLMOps, presents what LLMOps is, starting
with its roots in DevOps and MLOps. This chapter explains how to
deploy the LLM Twin project to the cloud, such as the ML pipelines to
AWS and shows how to containerize the code using Docker and
build a CI/CD/CT pipeline. It also adds a prompt monitoring layer on
top of LLM Twin’s inference pipeline.
Appendix, MLOps Principles, covers the six MLOps principles used
to build scalable, reproducible, and robust ML applications.

Understanding the LLM Twin
Concept and Architecture
By the end of this book, we will have walked you through the journey
of building an end-to-end large language model (LLM) product. We
firmly believe that the best way to learn about LLMs and production
machine learning (ML) is to get your hands dirty and build systems.
This book will show you how to build an LLM Twin, an AI character
that learns to write like a particular person by incorporating its style,
voice, and personality into an LLM. Using this example, we will walk
you through the complete ML life cycle, from data gathering to
deployment and monitoring. Most of the concepts learned while
implementing your LLM Twin can be applied in other LLM-based or
ML applications.
When starting to implement a new product, from an engineering
point of view, there are three planning steps we must go through
before we start building. First, it is critical to understand the problem
we are trying to solve and what we want to build. In our case, what
exactly is an LLM Twin, and why build it? This step is where we must
dream and focus on the “Why.” Secondly, to reflect a real-world
scenario, we will design the first iteration of a product with minimum

## Page 29

functionality. Here, we must clearly define the core features required
to create a working and valuable product. The choices are made
based on the timeline, resources, and team’s knowledge. This is
where we bridge the gap between dreaming and focusing on what is
realistic and eventually answer the following question: “What are we
going to build?”.
Finally, we will go through a system design step, laying out the core
architecture and design choices used to build the LLM system. Note
that the first two components are primarily product-related, while the
last one is technical and focuses on the “How.”
These three steps are natural in building a real-world product. Even
if the first two do not require much ML knowledge, it is critical to go
through them to understand “how” to build the product with a clear
vision. In a nutshell, this chapter covers the following topics:
Understanding the LLM Twin concept
Planning the MVP of the LLM Twin product
Building ML systems with feature/training/inference pipelines
Designing the system architecture of the LLM Twin
By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear picture of what you
will learn to build throughout the book.

## Page 30

Understanding the LLM Twin concept
The first step is to have a clear vision of what we want to create and
why it’s valuable to build it. The concept of an LLM Twin is new.
Thus, before diving into the technical details, it is essential to
understand what it is, what we should expect from it, and how it
should work. Having a solid intuition of your end goal makes it much
easier to digest the theory, code, and infrastructure presented in this
book.
What is an LLM Twin?
In a few words, an LLM Twin is an AI character that incorporates
your writing style, voice, and personality into an LLM, which is a
complex AI model. It is a digital version of yourself projected into an
LLM. Instead of a generic LLM trained on the whole internet, an LLM
Twin is fine-tuned on yourself. Naturally, as an ML model reflects the
data it is trained on, this LLM will incorporate your writing style,
voice, and personality. We intentionally used the word “projected.” As
with any other projection, you lose a lot of information along the way.
Thus, this LLM will not be you; it will copy the side of you reflected in
the data it was trained on.
It is essential to understand that an LLM reflects the data it was
trained on. If you feed it Shakespeare, it will start writing like him. If
you train it on Billie Eilish, it will start writing songs in her style. This

## Page 31

is also known as style transfer. This concept is prevalent in
generating images, too. For example, let’s say you want to create a
cat image using Van Gogh’s style. We will leverage the style transfer
strategy, but instead of choosing a personality, we will do it on our
own persona.
To adjust the LLM to a given style and voice along with fine-tuning,
we will also leverage various advanced retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) techniques to condition the autoregressive
process with previous embeddings of ourselves.
We will explore the details in Chapter 5 on fine-tuning and Chapters
4 and 9 on RAG, but for now, let’s look at a few examples to
intuitively understand what we stated previously.
Here are some scenarios of what you can fine-tune an LLM on to
become your twin:
LinkedIn posts and X threads: Specialize the LLM in writing
social media content.
Messages with your friends and family: Adapt the LLM to an
unfiltered version of yourself.
Academic papers and articles: Calibrate the LLM in writing
formal and educative content.
Code: Specialize the LLM in implementing code as you would.

## Page 32

All the preceding scenarios can be reduced to one core strategy:
collecting your digital data (or some parts of it) and feeding it to an
LLM using different algorithms. Ultimately, the LLM reflects the voice
and style of the collected data. Easy, right?
Unfortunately, this raises many technical and moral issues. First, on
the technical side, how can we access this data? Do we have
enough digital data to project ourselves into an LLM? What kind of
data would be valuable? Secondly, on the moral side, is it OK to do
this in the first place? Do we want to create a copycat of ourselves?
Will it write using our voice and personality, or just try to replicate it?
Remember that the role of this section is not to bother with the
“What” and “How” but with the “Why.” Let’s understand why it makes
sense to have your LLM Twin, why it can be valuable, and why it is
morally correct if we frame the problem correctly.
Why building an LLM Twin matters
As an engineer (or any other professional career), building a
personal brand is more valuable than a standard CV. The biggest
issue with creating a personal brand is that writing content on
platforms such as LinkedIn, X, or Medium takes a lot of time. Even if
you enjoy writing and creating content, you will eventually run out of
inspiration or time and feel like you need assistance. We don’t want

## Page 33

to transform this section into a pitch, but we have to understand the
scope of this product/project clearly.
We want to build an LLM Twin to write personalized content on
LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Substack, and Medium (or other blogs) using
our style and voice. It will not be used in any immoral scenarios, but
it will act as your writing co-pilot. Based on what we will teach you in
this book, you can get creative and adapt it to various use cases, but
we will focus on the niche of generating social media content and
articles. Thus, instead of writing the content from scratch, we can
feed the skeleton of our main idea to the LLM Twin and let it do the
grunt work.
Ultimately, we will have to check whether everything is correct and
format it to our liking (more on the concrete features in the Planning
the MVP of the LLM Twin product section). Hence, we project
ourselves into a content-writing LLM Twin that will help us automate
our writing process. It will likely fail if we try to use this particular LLM
in a different scenario, as this is where we will specialize the LLM
through fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and RAG.
So, why does building an LLM Twin matter? It helps you do the
following:
Create your brand

## Page 34

Automate the writing process
Brainstorm new creative ideas
What’s the difference between a co-pilot and an
LLM Twin?
A co-pilot and digital twin are two different concepts
that work together and can be combined into a
powerful solution:
The co-pilot is an AI assistant or tool that augments
human users in various programming, writing, or
content creation tasks.
The twin serves as a 1:1 digital representation of a
real-world entity, often using AI to bridge the gap
between the physical and digital worlds. For
instance, an LLM Twin is an LLM that learns to
mimic your voice, personality, and writing style.
With these definitions in mind, a writing and content
creation AI assistant who writes like you is your LLM
Twin co-pilot.
Also, it is critical to understand that building an LLM Twin is entirely
moral. The LLM will be fine-tuned only on our personal digital data.

## Page 35

We won’t collect and use other people’s data to try to impersonate
anyone’s identity. We have a clear goal in mind: creating our
personalized writing copycat. Everyone will have their own LLM Twin
with restricted access.
Of course, many security concerns are involved, but we won’t go into
that here as it could be a book in itself.
Why not use ChatGPT (or another similar
chatbot)?
This subsection will refer to using ChatGPT (or another
similar chatbot) just in the context of generating
personalized content.
We have already provided the answer. ChatGPT is not personalized
to your writing style and voice. Instead, it is very generic,
unarticulated, and wordy. Maintaining an original voice is critical for
long-term success when building your brand. Thus, directly using
ChatGPT or Gemini will not yield the most optimal results. Even if
you are OK with sharing impersonalized content, mindlessly using
ChatGPT can result in the following:
Misinformation due to hallucination: Manually checking the
results for hallucinations or using third-party tools to evaluate your

## Page 36

results is a tedious and unproductive experience.
Tedious manual prompting: You must manually craft your
prompts and inject external information, which is a tiresome
experience. Also, the generated answers will be hard to replicate
between multiple sessions as you don’t have complete control
over your prompts and injected data. You can solve part of this
problem using an API and a tool such as LangChain, but you
need programming experience to do so.
From our experience, if you want high-quality content that provides
real value, you will spend more time debugging the generated text
than writing it yourself.
The key of the LLM Twin stands in the following:
What data we collect
How we preprocess the data
How we feed the data into the LLM
How we chain multiple prompts for the desired results
How we evaluate the generated content
The LLM itself is important, but we want to highlight that using
ChatGPT’s web interface is exceptionally tedious in managing and
injecting various data sources or evaluating the outputs. The solution
is to build an LLM system that encapsulates and automates all the

## Page 37

following steps (manually replicating them each time is not a long-
term and feasible solution):
Data collection
Data preprocessing
Data storage, versioning, and retrieval
LLM fine-tuning
RAG
Content generation evaluation
Note that we never said not to use OpenAI’s GPT API, just that the
LLM framework we will present is LLM-agnostic. Thus, if it can be
manipulated programmatically and exposes a fine-tuning interface, it
can be integrated into the LLM Twin system we will learn to build.
The key to most successful ML products is to be data-centric and
make your architecture model-agnostic. Thus, you can quickly
experiment with multiple models on your specific data.
Planning the MVP of the LLM Twin
product
Now that we understand what an LLM Twin is and why we want to
build it, we must clearly define the product’s features. In this book,
we will focus on the first iteration, often labeled the minimum viable
product (MVP), to follow the natural cycle of most products. Here,

## Page 38

the main objective is to align our ideas with realistic and doable
business objectives using the available resources to produce the
product. Even as an engineer, as you grow up in responsibilities, you
must go through these steps to bridge the gap between the business
needs and what can be implemented.
What is an MVP?
An MVP is a version of a product that includes just enough features
to draw in early users and test the viability of the product concept in
the initial stages of development. Usually, the purpose of the MVP is
to gather insights from the market with minimal effort.
An MVP is a powerful strategy because of the following reasons:
Accelerated time-to-market: Launch a product quickly to gain
early traction
Idea validation: Test it with real users before investing in the full
development of the product
Market research: Gain insights into what resonates with the
target audience
Risk minimization: Reduces the time and resources needed for
a product that might not achieve market success
Sticking to the V in MVP is essential, meaning the product must be
viable. The product must provide an end-to-end user journey without

## Page 39

half-implemented features, even if the product is minimal. It must be
a working product with a good user experience that people will love
and want to keep using to see how it evolves to its full potential.
Defining the LLM Twin MVP
As a thought experiment, let’s assume that instead of building this
project for this book, we want to make a real product. In that case,
what are our resources? Well, unfortunately, not many:
We are a team of three people with two ML engineers and one ML
researcher
Our laptops
Personal funding for computing, such as training LLMs
Our enthusiasm
As you can see, we don’t have many resources. Even if this is just a
thought experiment, it reflects the reality for most start-ups at the
beginning of their journey. Thus, we must be very strategic in
defining our LLM Twin MVP and what features we want to pick. Our
goal is simple: we want to maximize the product’s value relative to
the effort and resources poured into it.
To keep it simple, we will build the features that can do the following
for the LLM Twin:

## Page 40

Collect data from your LinkedIn, Medium, Substack, and GitHub
profiles
Fine-tune an open-source LLM using the collected data
Populate a vector database (DB) using our digital data for RAG
Create LinkedIn posts leveraging the following:
User prompts
RAG to reuse and reference old content
New posts, articles, or papers as additional knowledge to the
LLM
Have a simple web interface to interact with the LLM Twin and be
able to do the following:
Configure your social media links and trigger the collection step
Send prompts or links to external resources
That will be the LLM Twin MVP. Even if it doesn’t sound like much,
remember that we must make this system cost effective, scalable,
and modular.
Even if we focus only on the core features of the LLM
Twin defined in this section, we will build the product
with the latest LLM research and best software
engineering and MLOps practices in mind. We aim to
show you how to engineer a cost-effective and scalable
LLM application.

## Page 41

Until now, we have examined the LLM Twin from the users’ and
businesses’ perspectives. The last step is to examine it from an
engineering perspective and define a development plan to
understand how to solve it technically. From now on, the book’s
focus will be on the implementation of the LLM Twin.
Building ML systems with
feature/training/inference pipelines
Before diving into the specifics of the LLM Twin architecture, we
must understand an ML system pattern at the core of the
architecture, known as the feature/training/inference (FTI)
architecture. This section will present a general overview of the FTI
pipeline design and how it can structure an ML application.
Let’s see how we can apply the FTI pipelines to the LLM Twin
architecture.
The problem with building ML systems
Building production-ready ML systems is much more than just
training a model. From an engineering point of view, training the
model is the most straightforward step in most use cases. However,
training a model becomes complex when deciding on the correct

## Page 42

architecture and hyperparameters. That’s not an engineering
problem but a research problem.
At this point, we want to focus on how to design a production-ready
architecture. Training a model with high accuracy is extremely
valuable, but just by training it on a static dataset, you are far from
deploying it robustly. We have to consider how to do the following:
Ingest, clean, and validate fresh data
Training versus inference setups
Compute and serve features in the right environment
Serve the model in a cost-effective way
Version, track, and share the datasets and models
Monitor your infrastructure and models
Deploy the model on a scalable infrastructure
Automate the deployments and training
These are the types of problems an ML or MLOps engineer must
consider, while the research or data science team is often
responsible for training the model.

## Page 43

Figure 1.1: Common elements from an ML system
The preceding figure shows all the components the Google Cloud
team suggests that a mature ML and MLOps system requires. Along
with the ML code, there are many moving pieces. The rest of the
system comprises configuration, automation, data collection, data
verification, testing and debugging, resource management, model
analysis, process and metadata management, serving infrastructure,

## Page 44

and monitoring. The point is that there are many components we
must consider when productionizing an ML model.
Thus, the critical question is this: How do we connect all these
components into a single homogenous system? We must create a
boilerplate for clearly designing ML systems to answer that question.
Similar solutions exist for classic software. For example, if you zoom
out, most software applications can be split between a DB, business
logic, and UI layer. Every layer can be as complex as needed, but at
a high-level overview, the architecture of standard software can be
boiled down to the previous three components.
Do we have something similar for ML applications? The first step is
to examine previous solutions and why they are unsuitable for
building scalable ML systems.
The issue with previous solutions
In Figure 1.2, you can observe the typical architecture present in
most ML applications. It is based on a monolithic batch architecture
that couples the feature creation, model training, and inference into
the same component. By taking this approach, you quickly solve one
critical problem in the ML world: the training-serving skew. The
training-serving skew happens when the features passed to the
model are computed differently at training and inference time.

## Page 45

In this architecture, the features are created using the same code.
Hence, the training-serving skew issue is solved by default. This
pattern works fine when working with small data. The pipeline runs
on a schedule in batch mode, and the predictions are consumed by
a third-party application such as a dashboard.
Figure 1.2: Monolithic batch pipeline architecture

## Page 46

Unfortunately, building a monolithic batch system raises many other
issues, such as the following:
Features are not reusable (by your system or others)
If the data increases, you have to refactor the whole code to
support PySpark or Ray
It’s hard to rewrite the prediction module in a more efficient
language such as C++, Java, or Rust
It’s hard to share the work between multiple teams between the
features, training, and prediction modules
It’s impossible to switch to streaming technology for real-time
training
In Figure 1.3, we can see a similar scenario for a real-time system.
This use case introduces another issue in addition to what we listed
before. To make the predictions, we have to transfer the whole state
through the client request so the features can be computed and
passed to the model.
Consider the scenario of computing movie recommendations for a
user. Instead of simply passing the user ID, we must transmit the
entire user state, including their name, age, gender, movie history,
and more. This approach is fraught with potential errors, as the client
must understand how to access this state, and it’s tightly coupled
with the model service.

## Page 47

Another example would be when implementing an LLM with RAG
support. The documents we add as context along the query
represent our external state. If we didn’t store the records in a vector
DB, we would have to pass them with the user query. To do so, the
client must know how to query and retrieve the documents, which is
not feasible. It is an antipattern for the client application to know how
to access or compute the features. If you don’t understand how RAG
works, we will explain it in detail in Chapters 8 and 9.

## Page 48

Figure 1.3: Stateless real-time architecture
In conclusion, our problem is accessing the features to make
predictions without passing them at the client’s request. For
example, based on our first user movie recommendation example,
how can we predict the recommendations solely based on the user’s
ID? Remember these questions, as we will answer them shortly.
Ultimately, on the other spectrum, Google Cloud provides a
production-ready architecture, as shown in Figure 1.4. Unfortunately,
even if it’s a feasible solution, it’s very complex and not intuitive. You
will have difficulty understanding this if you are not highly
experienced in deploying and keeping ML models in production.
Also, it is not straightforward to understand how to start small and
grow the system in time.

But here is where the FTI pipeline architectures kick in. The following
section will show you how to solve these fundamental issues using
an intuitive ML design.
The solution – ML pipelines for ML systems

## Page 50

The solution is based on creating a clear and straightforward mind
map that any team or person can follow to compute the features,
train the model, and make predictions. Based on these three critical
steps that any ML system requires, the pattern is known as the FTI
pipeline. So, how does this differ from what we presented before?
The pattern suggests that any ML system can be boiled down to
these three pipelines: feature, training, and inference (similar to the
DB, business logic, and UI layers from classic software). This is
powerful, as we can clearly define the scope and interface of each
pipeline. Also, it’s easier to understand how the three components
interact. Ultimately, we have just three instead of 20 moving pieces,
as suggested in Figure 1.4, which is much easier to work with and
define.
As shown in Figure 1.5, we have the feature, training, and inference
pipelines. We will zoom in on each of them and understand their
scope and interface.

## Page 51

Figure 1.5: FTI pipelines architecture
Before going into the details, it is essential to understand that each
pipeline is a different component that can run on a different process
or hardware. Thus, each pipeline can be written using a different
technology, by a different team, or scaled differently. The key idea is

## Page 52

that the design is very flexible to the needs of your team. It acts as a
mind map for structuring your architecture.
The feature pipeline
The feature pipeline takes raw data as input, processes it, and
outputs the features and labels required by the model for training or
inference. Instead of directly passing them to the model, the features
and labels are stored inside a feature store. Its responsibility is to
store, version, track, and share the features. By saving the features
in a feature store, we always have a state of our features. Thus, we
can easily send the features to the training and inference pipelines.
As the data is versioned, we can always ensure that the training and
inference time features match. Thus, we avoid the training-serving
skew problem.
The training pipeline
The training pipeline takes the features and labels from the features
stored as input and outputs a train model or models. The models are
stored in a model registry. Its role is similar to that of feature stores,
but this time, the model is the first-class citizen. Thus, the model
registry will store, version, track, and share the model with the
inference pipeline.

## Page 53

Also, most modern model registries support a metadata store that
allows you to specify essential aspects of how the model was
trained. The most important are the features, labels, and their
version used to train the model. Thus, we will always know what data
the model was trained on.
The inference pipeline
The inference pipeline takes as input the features and labels from
the feature store and the trained model from the model registry. With
these two, predictions can be easily made in either batch or real-time
mode.
As this is a versatile pattern, it is up to you to decide what you do
with your predictions. If it’s a batch system, they will probably be
stored in a DB. If it’s a real-time system, the predictions will be
served to the client who requested them. Additionally, the features,
labels, and models are versioned. We can easily upgrade or roll
back the deployment of the model. For example, we will always
know that model v1 uses features F1, F2, and F3, and model v2
uses F2, F3, and F4. Thus, we can quickly change the connections
between the model and features.
Benefits of the FTI architecture

## Page 54

To conclude, the most important thing you must remember about the
FTI pipelines is their interface:
The feature pipeline takes in data and outputs the features and
labels saved to the feature store.
The training pipeline queries the features store for features and
labels and outputs a model to the model registry.
The inference pipeline uses the features from the feature store
and the model from the model registry to make predictions.
It doesn’t matter how complex your ML system gets, these interfaces
will remain the same.
Now that we understand better how the pattern works, we want to
highlight the main benefits of using this pattern:
As you have just three components, it is intuitive to use and easy
to understand.
Each component can be written into its tech stack, so we can
quickly adapt them to specific needs, such as big or streaming
data. Also, it allows us to pick the best tools for the job.
As there is a transparent interface between the three components,
each one can be developed by a different team (if necessary),
making the development more manageable and scalable.

## Page 55

Every component can be deployed, scaled, and monitored
independently.
The final thing you must understand about the FTI pattern is that the
system doesn’t have to contain only three pipelines. In most cases, it
will include more. For example, the feature pipeline can be
composed of a service that computes the features and one that
validates the data. Also, the training pipeline can be composed of the
training and evaluation components.
The FTI pipelines act as logical layers. Thus, it is perfectly fine for
each to be complex and contain multiple services. However, what is
essential is to stick to the same interface on how the FTI pipelines
interact with each other through the feature store and model
registries. By doing so, each FTI component can evolve differently,
without knowing the details of each other and without breaking the
system on new changes.
To learn more about the FTI pipeline pattern, consider
reading From MLOps to ML Systems with
Feature/Training/Inference Pipelines by Jim Dowling,
CEO and co-founder of Hopsworks:
https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/mlops-to-ml-
systems-with-fti-pipelines. His article inspired
this section.

## Page 56

Now that we understand the FTI pipeline architecture, the final step
of this chapter is to see how it can be applied to the LLM Twin use
case.
Designing the system architecture of
the LLM Twin
In this section, we will list the concrete technical details of the LLM
Twin application and understand how we can solve them by
designing our LLM system using the FTI architecture. However,
before diving into the pipelines, we want to highlight that we won’t
focus on the tooling or the tech stack at this step. We only want to
define a high-level architecture of the system, which is language-,
framework-, platform-, and infrastructure-agnostic at this point. We
will focus on each component’s scope, interface, and
interconnectivity. In future chapters, we will cover the implementation
details and tech stack.
Listing the technical details of the LLM Twin
architecture
Until now, we defined what the LLM Twin should support from the
user’s point of view. Now, let’s clarify the requirements of the ML
system from a purely technical perspective:

## Page 57

On the data side, we have to do the following:
Collect data from LinkedIn, Medium, Substack, and GitHub
completely autonomously and on a schedule
Standardize the crawled data and store it in a data warehouse
Clean the raw data
Create instruct datasets for fine-tuning an LLM
Chunk and embed the cleaned data. Store the vectorized data
into a vector DB for RAG.
For training, we have to do the following:
Fine-tune LLMs of various sizes (7B, 14B, 30B, or 70B
parameters)
Fine-tune on instruction datasets of multiple sizes
Switch between LLM types (for example, between Mistral,
Llama, and GPT)
Track and compare experiments
Test potential production LLM candidates before deploying
them
Automatically start the training when new instruction datasets
are available.
The inference code will have the following properties:
A REST API interface for clients to interact with the LLM Twin
Access to the vector DB in real time for RAG
Inference with LLMs of various sizes
Autoscaling based on user requests

## Page 58

Automatically deploy the LLMs that pass the evaluation step.
The system will support the following LLMOps features:
Instruction dataset versioning, lineage, and reusability
Model versioning, lineage, and reusability
Experiment tracking
Continuous training, continuous integration, and
continuous delivery (CT/CI/CD)
Prompt and system monitoring
If any technical requirement doesn’t make sense now,
bear with us. To avoid repetition, we will examine the
details in their specific chapter.
The preceding list is quite comprehensive. We could have detailed it
even more, but at this point, we want to focus on the core
functionality. When implementing each component, we will look into
all the little details. But for now, the fundamental question we must
ask ourselves is this: How can we apply the FTI pipeline design to
implement the preceding list of requirements?
How to design the LLM Twin architecture using
the FTI pipeline design
We will split the system into four core components. You will ask
yourself this: “Four? Why not three, as the FTI pipeline design clearly

## Page 59

states?” That is a great question. Fortunately, the answer is simple.
We must also implement the data pipeline along the three
feature/training/inference pipelines. According to best practices:
The data engineering team owns the data pipeline
The ML engineering team owns the FTI pipelines.
Given our goal of building an MVP with a small team, we must
implement the entire application. This includes defining the data
collection and FTI pipelines. Tackling a problem end to end is often
encountered in start-ups that can’t afford dedicated teams. Thus,
engineers have to wear many hats, depending on the state of the
product. Nevertheless, in any scenario, knowing how an end-to-end
ML system works is valuable for better understanding other people’s
work.
Figure 1.6 shows the LLM system architecture. The best way to
understand it is to review the four components individually and
explain how they work.

## Page 60

Figure 1.6: LLM Twin high-level architecture
Data collection pipeline
The data collection pipeline involves crawling your personal data
from Medium, Substack, LinkedIn, and GitHub. As a data pipeline,

## Page 61

we will use the extract, load, transform (ETL) pattern to extract
data from social media platforms, standardize it, and load it into a
data warehouse.
It is critical to highlight that the data collection pipeline
is designed to crawl data only from your social media
platform. It will not have access to other people. As an
example for this book, we agreed to make our collected
data available for learning purposes. Otherwise, using
other people’s data without their consent is not moral.
The output of this component will be a NoSQL DB, which will act as
our data warehouse. As we work with text data, which is naturally
unstructured, a NoSQL DB fits like a glove.
Even though a NoSQL DB, such as MongoDB, is not labeled as a
data warehouse, from our point of view, it will act as one. Why?
Because it stores standardized raw data gathered by various ETL
pipelines that are ready to be ingested into an ML system.
The collected digital data is binned into three categories:
Articles (Medium, Substack)
Posts (LinkedIn)
Code (GitHub)

## Page 62

We want to abstract away the platform where the data was crawled.
For example, when feeding an article to the LLM, knowing it came
from Medium or Substack is not essential. We can keep the source
URL as metadata to give references. However, from the processing,
fine-tuning, and RAG points of view, it is vital to know what type of
data we ingested, as each category must be processed differently.
For example, the chunking strategy between a post, article, and
piece of code will look different.
Also, by grouping the data by category, not the source, we can
quickly plug data from other platforms, such as X into the posts or
GitLab into the code collection. As a modular system, we must attach
an additional ETL in the data collection pipeline, and everything else
will work without further code modifications.
Feature pipeline
The feature pipeline’s role is to take raw articles, posts, and code
data points from the data warehouse, process them, and load them
into the feature store.
The characteristics of the FTI pattern are already present.
Here are some custom properties of the LLM Twin’s feature pipeline:

## Page 63

It processes three types of data differently: articles, posts, and
code
It contains three main processing steps necessary for fine-tuning
and RAG: cleaning, chunking, and embedding
It creates two snapshots of the digital data, one after cleaning
(used for fine-tuning) and one after embedding (used for RAG)
It uses a logical feature store instead of a specialized feature
store
Let’s zoom in on the logical feature store part a bit. As with any RAG-
based system, one of the central pieces of the infrastructure is a
vector DB. Instead of integrating another DB, more concretely, a
specialized feature store, we used the vector DB, plus some
additional logic to check all the properties of a feature store our
system needs.
The vector DB doesn’t offer the concept of a training dataset, but it
can be used as a NoSQL DB. This means we can access data points
using their ID and collection name. Thus, we can easily query the
vector DB for new data points without any vector search logic.
Ultimately, we will wrap the retrieved data into a versioned, tracked,
and shareable artifact—more on artifacts in Chapter 2. For now, you
must know it is an MLOps concept used to wrap data and enrich it
with the properties listed before.

## Page 64

How will the rest of the system access the logical feature store? The
training pipeline will use the instruct datasets as artifacts, and the
inference pipeline will query the vector DB for additional context
using vector search techniques.
For our use case, this is more than enough because of the following
reasons:
The artifacts work great for offline use cases such as training
The vector DB is built for online access, which we require for
inference.
In future chapters, however, we will explain how the three data
categories (articles, posts, and code) are cleaned, chunked, and
embedded.
To conclude, we take in raw article, post, or code data points,
process them, and store them in a feature store to make them
accessible to the training and inference pipelines. Note that trimming
all the complexity away and focusing only on the interface is a
perfect match with the FTI pattern. Beautiful, right?
Training pipeline
The training pipeline consumes instruct datasets from the feature
store, fine-tunes an LLM with it, and stores the tuned LLM weights in

## Page 65

a model registry. More concretely, when a new instruct dataset is
available in the logical feature store, we will trigger the training
pipeline, consume the artifact, and fine-tune the LLM.
In the initial stages, the data science team owns this step. They run
multiple experiments to find the best model and hyperparameters for
the job, either through automatic hyperparameter tuning or manually.
To compare and pick the best set of hyperparameters, we will use an
experiment tracker to log everything of value and compare it
between experiments. Ultimately, they will pick the best
hyperparameters and fine-tuned LLM and propose it as the LLM
production candidate. The proposed LLM is then stored in the model
registry. After the experimentation phase is over, we store and reuse
the best hyperparameters found to eliminate the manual restrictions
of the process. Now, we can completely automate the training
process, known as continuous training.
The testing pipeline is triggered for a more detailed analysis than
during fine-tuning. Before pushing the new model to production,
assessing it against a stricter set of tests is critical to see that the
latest candidate is better than what is currently in production. If this
step passes, the model is ultimately tagged as accepted and
deployed to the production inference pipeline. Even in a fully
automated ML system, it is recommended to have a manual step
before accepting a new production model. It is like pushing the red

## Page 66

button before a significant action with high consequences. Thus, at
this stage, an expert looks at a report generated by the testing
component. If everything looks good, it approves the model, and the
automation can continue.
The particularities of this component will be on LLM aspects, such as
the following:
How do you implement an LLM agnostic pipeline?
What fine-tuning techniques should you use?
How do you scale the fine-tuning algorithm on LLMs and datasets
of various sizes?
How do you pick an LLM production candidate from multiple
experiments?
How do you test the LLM to decide whether to push it to
production or not?
By the end of this book, you will know how to answer all these
questions.
One last aspect we want to clarify is CT. Our modular design allows
us to quickly leverage an ML orchestrator to schedule and trigger
different system parts. For example, we can schedule the data
collection pipeline to crawl data every week.

## Page 67

Then, we can trigger the feature pipeline when new data is available
in the data warehouse and the training pipeline when new instruction
datasets are available.
Inference pipeline
The inference pipeline is the last piece of the puzzle. It is connected
to the model registry and logical feature store. It loads a fine-tuned
LLM from the model registry, and from the logical feature store, it
accesses the vector DB for RAG. It takes in client requests through a
REST API as queries. It uses the fine-tuned LLM and access to the
vector DB to carry out RAG and answer the queries.
All the client queries, enriched prompts using RAG, and generated
answers are sent to a prompt monitoring system to analyze, debug,
and better understand the system. Based on specific requirements,
the monitoring system can trigger alarms to take action either
manually or automatically.
At the interface level, this component follows exactly the FTI
architecture, but when zooming in, we can observe unique
characteristics of an LLM and RAG system, such as the following:
A retrieval client used to do vector searches for RAG
Prompt templates used to map user queries and external
information to LLM inputs

## Page 68

Special tools for prompt monitoring
Final thoughts on the FTI design and the LLM
Twin architecture
We don’t have to be highly rigid about the FTI pattern. It is a tool
used to clarify how to design ML systems. For example, instead of
using a dedicated features store just because that is how it is done,
in our system, it is easier and cheaper to use a logical feature store
based on a vector DB and artifacts. What was important to focus on
were the required properties a feature store provides, such as a
versioned and reusable training dataset.
Ultimately, we will explain the computing requirements of each
component briefly. The data collection and feature pipeline are
mostly CPU-based and do not require powerful machines. The
training pipeline requires powerful GPU-based machines that could
load an LLM and fine-tune it. The inference pipeline is somewhere in
the middle. It still needs a powerful machine but is less compute-
intensive than the training step. However, it must be tested carefully,
as the inference pipeline directly interfaces with the user. Thus, we
want the latency to be within the required parameters for a good user
experience. However, using the FTI design is not an issue. We can
pick the proper computing requirements for each component.

## Page 69

Also, each pipeline will be scaled differently. The data and feature
pipelines will be scaled horizontally based on the CPU and RAM
load. The training pipeline will be scaled vertically by adding more
GPUs. The inference pipeline will be scaled horizontally based on
the number of client requests.
To conclude, the presented LLM architecture checks all the technical
requirements listed at the beginning of the section. It processes the
data as requested, and the training is modular and can be quickly
adapted to different LLMs, datasets, or fine-tuning techniques. The
inference pipeline supports RAG and is exposed as a REST API. On
the LLMOps side, the system supports dataset and model
versioning, lineage, and reusability. The system has a monitoring
service, and the whole ML architecture is designed with CT/CI/CD in
mind.
This concludes the high-level overview of the LLM Twin architecture.
Summary
This first chapter was critical to understanding the book’s goal. As a
product-oriented book that will walk you through building an end-to-
end ML system, it was essential to understand the concept of an
LLM Twin initially. Afterward, we walked you through what an MVP is
and how to plan our LLM Twin MVP based on our available
resources. Following this, we translated our concept into a practical

## Page 70

technical solution with specific requirements. In this context, we
introduced the FTI design pattern and showcased its real-world
application in designing systems that are both modular and scalable.
Ultimately, we successfully applied the FTI pattern to design the
architecture of the LLM Twin to fit all our technical requirements.
Having a clear vision of the big picture is essential when building
systems. Understanding how a single component will be integrated
into the rest of the application can be very valuable when working on
it. We started with a more abstract presentation of the LLM Twin
architecture, focusing on each component’s scope, interface, and
interconnectivity.
The following chapters will explore how to implement and deploy
each component. On the MLOps side, we will walk you through
using a computing platform, orchestrator, model registry, artifacts,
and other tools and concepts to support all MLOps best practices.

Tooling and Installation
This chapter presents all the essential tools that will be used
throughout the book, especially in implementing and deploying the
LLM Twin project. At this point in the book, we don’t plan to present
in-depth LLM, RAG, MLOps, or LLMOps concepts. We will quickly
walk you through our tech stack and prerequisites to avoid repeating
ourselves throughout the book on how to set up a particular tool and
why we chose it. Starting with Chapter 3, we will begin exploring our
LLM Twin use case by implementing a data collection ETL that
crawls data from the internet.
In the first part of the chapter, we will present the tools within the
Python ecosystem to manage multiple Python versions, create a
virtual environment, and install the pinned dependencies required for
our project to run. Alongside presenting these tools, we will also
show how to install the LLM-Engineers-Handbook repository on
your local machine (in case you want to try out the code yourself):
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook.
Next, we will explore all the MLOps and LLMOps tools we will use,
starting with more generic tools, such as a model registry, and

## Page 74

moving on to more LLM-oriented tools, such as LLM evaluation and
prompt monitoring tools. We will also understand how to manage a
project with multiple ML pipelines using ZenML, an orchestrator
bridging the gap between ML and MLOps. Also, we will quickly
explore what databases we will use for NoSQL and vector storage.
We will show you how to run all these components on your local
machine using Docker. Lastly, we will quickly review AWS and show
you how to create an AWS user and access keys and install and
configure the AWS CLI to manipulate your cloud resources
programmatically. We will also explore SageMaker and why we use it
to train and deploy our open-source LLMs.
If you are familiar with these tools, you can safely skip this chapter.
We also explain how to install the project and set up all the
necessary components in the repository’s README . Thus, you also
have the option to use that as more concise documentation if you
plan to run the code while reading the book.
To sum all that up, in this chapter, we will explore the following
topics:
Python ecosystem and project installation
MLOps and LLMOps tooling
Databases for storing unstructured and vector data
Preparing for AWS

## Page 75

By the end of this chapter, you will be aware of all the tools we will
use across the book. Also, you will have learned how to install the
LLM-Engineers-Handbook repository, set up the rest of the tools,
and use them if you run the code while reading the book.
Python ecosystem and project
installation
Any Python project needs three fundamental tools: the Python
interpreter, dependency management, and a task execution tool. The
Python interpreter executes your Python project as expected. All the
code within the book is tested with Python 3.11.8. You can download
the Python interpreter from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/. We recommend installing
the exact Python version (Python 3.11.8) to run the LLM Twin project
using pyenv , making the installation process straightforward.
Instead of installing multiple global Python versions, we recommend
managing them using pyenv , a Python version management tool
that lets you manage multiple Python versions between projects. You
can install it using this link: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?
tab=readme-ov-file#installation.
After you have installed pyenv , you can install the latest version of
Python 3.11, using pyenv , as follows:

## Page 76

pyenv install 3.11.8
Now list all installed Python versions to see that it was installed
correctly:
pyenv versions
You should see something like this:
# * system
# 3.11.8
To make Python 3.11.8 the default version across your entire system
(whenever you open a new terminal), use the following command:
pyenv global 3.11.8
However, we aim to use Python 3.11.8 locally only in our repository.
To achieve that, first, we have to clone the repository and navigate to
it:
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-E
cd LLM-Engineers-Handbook

## Page 77

Because we defined a .python-version file within the repository,
pyenv will know to pick up the version from that file and use it
locally whenever you are working within that folder. To double-check
that, run the following command while you are in the repository:
python --version
It should output:
# Python 3.11.8
To create the .python-version file, you must run pyenv local
3.11.8 once. Then, pyenv will always know to use that Python
version while working within a specific directory.
Now that we have installed the correct Python version using pyenv ,
let’s move on to Poetry, which we will use as our dependency and
virtual environment manager.
Poetry: dependency and virtual environment
management
Poetry is one of the most popular dependency and virtual
environment managers within the Python ecosystem. But let’s start
by clarifying what a dependency manager is. In Python, a

## Page 78

dependency manager allows you to specify, install, update, and
manage external libraries or packages (dependencies) that a project
relies on. For example, this is a simple Poetry requirements file that
uses Python 3.11 and the requests and numpy Python packages.
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
requests = "^2.25.1"
numpy = "^1.19.5"
[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
By using Poetry to pin your dependencies, you always ensure that
you install the correct version of the dependencies that your projects
work with. Poetry, by default, saves all its requirements in
pyproject.toml files, which are stored at the root of your
repository, as you can see in the cloned LLM-Engineers-Handbook
repository.
Another massive advantage of using Poetry is that it creates a new
Python virtual environment in which it installs the specified Python
version and requirements. A virtual environment allows you to isolate
your project’s dependencies from your global Python dependencies
and other projects. By doing so, you ensure there are no version

## Page 79

clashes between projects. For example, let’s assume that Project A
needs numpy == 1.19.5 , and Project B needs numpy ==
1.26.0 . If you keep both projects in the global Python environment,
that will not work, as Project B will override Project A’s numpy
installation, which will corrupt Project A and stop it from working.
Using Poetry, you can isolate each project in its own Python
environment with its own Python dependencies, avoiding any
dependency clashes.
You can install Poetry from here: https://python-
poetry.org/docs/. We use Poetry 1.8.3 throughout the book. Once
Poetry is installed, navigate to your cloned LLM-Engineers-
Handbook repository and run the following command to install all the
necessary Python dependencies:
poetry install --without aws
This command knows to pick up all the dependencies from your
repository that are listed in the pyproject.toml and
poetry.lock files. After the installation, you can activate your
Poetry environment by running poetry shell in your terminal or
by prefixing all your CLI commands as follows: poetry run <your
command> .

## Page 80

One final note on Poetry is that it locks down the exact versions of
the dependency tree in the poetry.lock file based on the
definitions added to the project.toml file. While the
pyproject.toml file may specify version ranges (e.g., requests
= "^2.25.1" ), the poetry.lock file records the exact version
(e.g., requests = "2.25.1" ) that was installed. It also locks the
versions of sub-dependencies (dependencies of your
dependencies), which may not be explicitly listed in your
pyproject.toml file. By locking all the dependencies and sub-
dependencies to specific versions, the poetry.lock file ensures
that all project installations use the same versions of each package.
This consistency leads to predictable behavior, reducing the
likelihood of encountering “works on my machine” issues.
Other tools similar to Poetry are Venv and Conda for creating virtual
environments. Still, they lack the dependency management option.
Thus, you must do it through Python’s default requirements.txt
files, which are less powerful than Poetry’s lock files. Another
option is Pipenv, which feature-wise is more like Poetry but slower,
and uv , which is a replacement for Poetry built in Rust, making it
blazing fast. uv has lots of potential to replace Poetry, making it
worthwhile to test out: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.
The final piece of the puzzle is to look at the task execution tool we
used to manage all our CLI commands.

## Page 81

Poe the Poet: task execution tool
Poe the Poet is a plugin on top of Poetry that is used to manage and
execute all the CLI commands required to interact with the project. It
helps you define and run tasks within your Python project, simplifying
automation and script execution. Other popular options are Makefile,
Invoke, or shell scripts, but Poe the Poet eliminates the need to write
separate shell scripts or Makefiles for managing project tasks,
making it an elegant way to manage tasks using the same
configuration file that Poetry already uses for dependencies.
When working with Poe the Poet, instead of having all your
commands documented in a README file or other document, you
can add them directly to your pyproject.toml file and execute
them in the command line with an alias. For example, using Poe the
Poet, we can define the following tasks in a pyproject.toml file:
[tool.poe.tasks]
test = "pytest"
format = "black ."
start = "python main.py"
You can then run these tasks using the poe command:

## Page 82

poetry poe test
poetry poe format
poetry poe start
You can install Poe the Poet as a Poetry plugin, as follows:
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugin]'
To conclude, using a tool as a façade over all your CLI commands is
necessary to run your application. It significantly simplifies the
application’s complexity and enhances collaboration as it acts as
out-of-the-box documentation.
Assuming you have pyenv and Poetry installed, here are all the
commands you need to run to clone the repository and install the
dependencies and Poe the Poet as a Poetry plugin:
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-E
poetry install --without aws
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugin]'
To make the project fully operational, there are still a few steps to
follow, such as filling out a .env file with your credentials and
getting tokens from OpenAI and Hugging Face. But this book isn’t an

## Page 83

installation guide, so we’ve moved all these details into the
repository’s README as they are useful only if you plan to run the
repository: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-Handbook.
Now that we have installed our Python project, let’s present the
MLOps tools we will use in the book. If you are already familiar with
these tools, you can safely skip the following tooling section and
move on to the Databases for storing unstructured and vector data
section.
MLOps and LLMOps tooling
This section will quickly present all the MLOps and LLMOps tools we
will use throughout the book and their role in building ML systems
using MLOps best practices. At this point in the book, we don’t aim to
detail all the MLOps components we will use to implement the LLM
Twin use case, such as model registries and orchestrators, but only
provide a quick idea of what they are and how to use them. As we
develop the LLM Twin project throughout the book, you will see
hands-on examples of how we use all these tools. In Chapter 11, we
will dive deeply into the theory of MLOps and LLMOps and connect
all the dots. As the MLOps and LLMOps fields are highly practical,
we will leave the theory of these aspects to the end, as it will be

## Page 84

much easier to understand it after you go through the LLM Twin use
case implementation.
Also, this section is not dedicated to showing you how to set up each
tool. It focuses primarily on what each tool is used for and highlights
the core features used throughout this book.
Still, using Docker, you can quickly run the whole infrastructure
locally. If you want to run the steps within the book yourself, you can
host the application locally with these three simple steps:
1. Have Docker 27.1.1 (or higher) installed.
2. Fill your .env file with all the necessary credentials as explained
in the repository README.
3. Run poetry poe local-infrastructure-up to locally spin
up ZenML ( http://127.0.0.1:8237/ ) and the MongoDB and
Qdrant databases.
You can read more details on how to run everything locally in the
LLM-Engineers-Handbook repository README:
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook. Within the book, we will also show you how to deploy
each component to the cloud.
Hugging Face: model registry

## Page 85

A model registry is a centralized repository that manages ML models
throughout their lifecycle. It stores models along with their metadata,
version history, and performance metrics, serving as a single source
of truth. In MLOps, a model registry is crucial for tracking, sharing,
and documenting model versions, facilitating team collaboration.
Also, it is a fundamental element in the deployment process as it
integrates with continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
We used Hugging Face as our model registry, as we can leverage its
ecosystem to easily share our fine-tuned LLM Twin models with
anyone who reads the book. Also, by following the Hugging Face
model registry interface, we can easily integrate the model with all
the frameworks around the LLMs ecosystem, such as Unsloth for
fine-tuning and SageMaker for inference.
Our fine-tuned LLMs are available on Hugging Face at:
TwinLlama 3.1 8B (after fine-tuning):
https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B
TwinLlama 3.1 8B DPO (after preference alignment):
https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO

## Page 86

Figure 2.1: Hugging Face model registry example
For a quick demo, we have them available on Hugging Face Spaces:
TwinLlama 3.1 8B:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-
8B
TwinLlama 3.1 8B DPO:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-
8B-DPO
Most ML tools provide model registry features. For example, ZenML,
Comet, and SageMaker, which we will present in future sections,
also offer their own model registries. They are good options, but we
picked Hugging Face solely because of its ecosystem, which
provides easy shareability and integration throughout the open-

## Page 87

source environment. Thus, you will usually select the model registry
that integrates the most with your project’s tooling and requirements.
ZenML: orchestrator, artifacts, and metadata
ZenML acts as the bridge between ML and MLOps. Thus, it offers
multiple MLOps features that make your ML pipeline traceability,
reproducibility, deployment, and maintainability easier. At its core, it
is designed to create reproducible workflows in machine learning. It
addresses the challenge of transitioning from exploratory research in
Jupyter notebooks to a production-ready ML environment. It tackles
production-based replication issues, such as versioning difficulties,
reproducing experiments, organizing complex ML workflows,
bridging the gap between training and deployment, and tracking
metadata. Thus, ZenML’s main features are orchestrating ML
pipelines, storing and versioning ML pipelines as outputs, and
attaching metadata to artifacts for better observability.
Instead of being another ML platform, ZenML introduced the concept
of a stack, which allows you to run ZenML on multiple infrastructure
options. A stack will enable you to connect ZenML to different cloud
services, such as:
An orchestrator and compute engine (for example, AWS
SageMaker or Vertex AI)

## Page 88

Remote storage (for instance, AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage
buckets)
A container registry (for example, Docker Registry or AWS ECR)
Thus, ZenML acts as a glue that brings all your infrastructure and
tools together in one place through its stack feature, allowing you to
quickly iterate through your development processes and easily
monitor your entire ML system. The beauty of this is that ZenML
doesn’t vendor-lock you into any cloud platform. It completely
abstracts away the implementation of your Python code from the
infrastructure it runs on. For example, in our LLM Twin use case, we
used the AWS stack:
SageMaker as our orchestrator and compute
S3 as our remote storage used to store and track artifacts
ECR as our container registry
However, the Python code contains no S3 or ECR particularities, as
ZenML takes care of them. Thus, we can easily switch to other
providers, such as Google Cloud Storage or Azure. For more details
on ZenML stacks, you can start here:
https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-
guide/understand-stacks.

## Page 89

We will focus only on the ZenML features used
throughout the book, such as orchestrating, artifacts,
and metadata. For more details on ZenML, check out
their starter guide: https://docs.zenml.io/user-
guide/starter-guide.
The local version of the ZenML server comes installed as a Python
package. Thus, when running poetry install , it installs a ZenML
debugging server that you can use locally. In Chapter 11, we will
show you how to use their cloud serverless option to deploy the ML
pipelines to AWS.
Orchestrator
An orchestrator is a system that automates, schedules, and
coordinates all your ML pipelines. It ensures that each pipeline—
such as data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and
deployment—executes in the correct order and handles
dependencies efficiently. By managing these processes, an
orchestrator optimizes resource utilization, handles failures
gracefully, and enhances scalability, making complex ML pipelines
more reliable and easier to manage.
How does ZenML work as an orchestrator? It works with
pipelines and steps. A pipeline is a high-level object that contains

## Page 90

multiple steps. A function becomes a ZenML pipeline by being
decorated with @pipeline , and a step when decorated with
@step . This is a standard pattern when using orchestrators: you
have a high-level function, often called a pipeline, that calls multiple
units/steps/tasks.
Let’s explore how we can implement a ZenML pipeline with one of
the ML pipelines implemented for the LLM Twin project. In the code
snippet below, we defined a ZenML pipeline that queries the
database for a user based on its full name and crawls all the
provided links under that user:
from zenml import pipeline
from steps.etl import crawl_links, get_or_create_u
@pipeline
def digital_data_etl(user_full_name: str, links: l
user = get_or_create_user(user_full_name)
crawl_links(user=user, links=links)
You can run the pipeline with the following CLI command: poetry
poe run-digital-data-etl . To visualize the pipeline run, you can
go to your ZenML dashboard (at http://127.0.0.1:8237/ ) and,
on the left panel, click on the Pipelines tab and then on the
digital_data_etl pipeline, as illustrated in Figure 2.2:

## Page 91

Figure 2.2: ZenML Pipelines dashboard
After clicking on the digital_data_etl pipeline, you can visualize all
the previous and current pipeline runs, as seen in Figure 2.3. You
can see which one succeeded, failed, or is still running. Also, you
can see the stack used to run the pipeline, where the default stack is
the one used to run your ML pipelines locally.

## Page 92

Figure 2.3: ZenML digital_data_etl pipeline dashboard. Example of a
specific pipeline
Now, after clicking on the latest digital_data_etl pipeline run (or any
other run that succeeded or is still running), we can visualize the
pipeline’s steps, outputs, and insights, as illustrated in Figure 2.4.
This structure is often called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). More
on DAGs in Chapter 11.

## Page 93

Figure 2.4: ZenML digital_data_etl pipeline run dashboard (example
of a specific pipeline run)
By clicking on a specific step, you can get more insights into its code
and configuration. It even aggregates the logs output by that specific
step to avoid switching between tools, as shown in Figure 2.5.

## Page 94

Figure 2.5: Example of insights from a specific step of the
digital_data_etl pipeline run
Now that we understand how to define a ZenML pipeline and how to
look it up in the dashboard, let’s quickly look at how to define a
ZenML step. In the code snippet below, we defined the
get_or_create_user() step, which works just like a normal
Python function but is decorated with @step . We won’t go into the
details of the logic, as we will cover the ETL logic in Chapter 3. For
now, we will focus only on the ZenML functionality.
from loguru import logger
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from zenml import get_step_context, step
from llm engineering application import utils

## Page 95

from llm_engineering.application import utils
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import UserD
@step
def get_or_create_user(user_full_name: str) -> Ann
logger.info(f"Getting or creating user: {user_
first_name, last_name = utils.split_user_full_
user = UserDocument.get_or_create(first_name=f
return user
Within a ZenML step, you can define any Python logic your use case
needs. In this simple example, we are just creating or retrieving a
user, but we could replace that code with anything, starting from data
collection to feature engineering and training. What is essential to
notice is that to integrate ZenML with your code, you have to write
modular code, where each function does just one thing. The
modularity of your code makes it easy to decorate your functions
with @step and then glue multiple steps together within a main
function decorated with @pipeline . One design choice that will
impact your application is deciding the granularity of each step, as
each will run as a different unit on a different machine when
deployed in the cloud.
To decouple our code from ZenML, we encapsulated all the
application and domain logic into the llm_engineering Python
module. We also defined the pipelines and steps folders, where

## Page 96

we defined our ZenML logic. Within the steps module, we only
used what we needed from the llm_engineering Python module
(similar to how you use a Python package). In the pipelines
module, we only aggregated ZenML steps to glue them into the final
pipeline. Using this design, we can easily swap ZenML with another
orchestrator or use our application logic in other use cases, such as
a REST API. We only have to replace the ZenML code without
touching the llm_engineering module where all our logic resides.
This folder structure is reflected at the root of the LLM-Engineers-
Handbook repository, as illustrated in Figure 2.6:

## Page 97

Figure 2.6: LLM-Engineers-Handbook repository folder structure
One last thing to consider when writing ZenML steps is that if you
return a value, it should be serializable. ZenML can serialize most
objects that can be reduced to primitive data types, but there are a
few exceptions. For example, we used UUID types as IDs
throughout the code, which aren’t natively supported by ZenML.
Thus, we had to extend ZenML’s materializer to support UUIDs. We
raised this issue to ZenML. Hence, in future ZenML versions, UUIDs
will be supported, but it was an excellent example of the serialization
aspect of transforming function outputs in artifacts.
Artifacts and metadata
As mentioned in the previous section, ZenML transforms any step
output into an artifact. First, let’s quickly understand what an artifact
is. In MLOps, an artifact is any file(s) produced during the machine
learning lifecycle, such as datasets, trained models, checkpoints, or
logs. Artifacts are crucial for reproducing experiments and deploying
models. We can transform anything into an artifact. For example, the
model registry is a particular use case for an artifact. Thus, artifacts
have these unique properties: they are versioned, sharable, and
have metadata attached to them to understand what’s inside quickly.
For example, when wrapping your dataset with an artifact, you can
add to its metadata the size of the dataset, the train-test split ratio,

## Page 98

the size, types of labels, and anything else useful to understand
what’s inside the dataset without actually downloading it.
Let’s circle back to our digital_data_etl pipeline example, where we
had as a step output an artifact, the crawled links, which are an
artifact, as seen in Figure 2.7
Figure 2.7: ZenML artifact example using the digital_data_etl
pipeline as an example
By clicking on the crawled_links artifact and navigating to the
Metadata tab, we can quickly see all the domains we crawled for a
particular author, the number of links we crawled for each domain,
and how many were successful, as illustrated in Figure 2.8:

## Page 99

Figure 2.8: ZenML metadata example using the digital_data_etl
pipeline as an example
A more interesting example of an artifact and its metadata is the
generated dataset artifact. In Figure 2.9, we can visualize the
metadata of the instruct_datasets artifact, which was
automatically generated and will be used to fine-tune the LLM Twin
model. More details on the instruction datasets are in Chapter
5. For now, we want to highlight that within the dataset’s metadata,

## Page 100

we have precomputed a lot of helpful information about it, such as
how many data categories it contains, its storage size, and the
number of samples per training and testing split.

## Page 101

Figure 2.9: ZenML metadata example for the instruct_datasets
artifact

## Page 102

The metadata is manually added to the artifact, as shown in the code
snippet below. Thus, you can precompute and attach to the artifact’s
metadata anything you consider helpful for dataset discovery across
your business and projects:
… # More imports
from zenml import ArtifactConfig, get_step_context
@step
def generate_intruction_dataset(
prompts: Annotated[dict[DataCategory, list[Gen
InstructTrainTestSplit,
ArtifactConfig(
name="instruct_datasets",
tags=["dataset", "instruct", "cleaned"],
),
]:
datasets = … # Generate datasets
step_context = get_step_context()
step_context.add_output_metadata(output_name="
return datasets
def _get_metadata_instruct_dataset(datasets: Instr
instruct_dataset_categories = list(datasets.tr
train_num_samples = {
category: instruct_dataset.num_samples for
}
test_num_samples = {category: instruct_dataset
return {
"data categories": instruct dataset catego

## Page 103

data_categories : instruct_dataset_catego
"test_split_size": datasets.test_split_siz
"train_num_samples_per_category": train_nu
"test_num_samples_per_category": test_num_
}
Also, you can easily download and access a specific version of the
dataset using its Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), which you
can find using the ZenML dashboard or CLI:
from zenml.client import Client
artifact = Client().get_artifact_version('8bba35c4
loaded_artifact = artifact.load()
The last step in exploring ZenML is understanding how to run and
configure a ZenML pipeline.
How to run and configure a ZenML
pipeline
All the ZenML pipelines can be called from the run.py file,
accessed at tools/run.py in our GitHub repository. Within the
run.py file, we implemented a simple CLI that allows you to specify

## Page 104

what pipeline to run. For example, to call the digital_data_etl
pipeline to crawl Maxime’s content, you have to run:
python -m tools.run --run-etl --no-cache --etl-con
Or, to crawl Paul’s content, you can run:
python -m tools.run --run-etl --no-cache --etl-con
As explained when introducing Poe the Poet, all our CLI commands
used to interact with the project will be executed through Poe to
simplify and standardize the project. Thus, we encapsulated these
Python calls under the following poe CLI commands:
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl-maxime
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl-paul
We only change the ETL config file name when scraping content for
different people. ZenML allows us to inject specific configuration files
at runtime as follows:
config_path = root_dir / "configs" / etl_config_fi
assert config_path.exists(), f"Config file not fou
run args etl = {

## Page 105

run_args_etl = {
"config_path": config_path,
"run_name": f"digital_data_etl_run_{dt.now
}
digital_data_etl.with_options()(**run_args_etl)
In the config file, we specify all the parameters that will input the
pipeline as parameters. For example, the
configs/digital_data_etl_maxime_labonne.yaml
configuration file looks as follows:
parameters:
user_full_name: Maxime Labonne # [First Name(s)]
links:
# Personal Blog
- https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/posts/2024-0
- https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/posts/2024-0
# Substack
- https://maximelabonne.substack.com/p/uncenso
… # More links
Where the digital_data_etl function signature looks like this:
@pipeline
def digital_data_etl(user_full_name: str, links: l

## Page 106

This approach allows us to configure each pipeline at runtime
without modifying the code. We can also clearly track the inputs for
all our pipelines, ensuring reproducibility. As seen in Figure 2.10, we
have one or more configs for each pipeline.

## Page 107

Figure 2.10: ZenML pipeline configs
Other popular orchestrators similar to ZenML that we’ve personally
tested and consider powerful are Airflow, Prefect, Metaflow, and
Dagster. Also, if you are a heavy user of Kubernetes, you can opt for
Agro Workflows or Kubeflow, the latter of which works only on top of
Kubernetes. We still consider ZenML the best trade-off between
ease of use, features, and costs. Also, none of these tools offer the
stack feature that is offered by ZenML, which allows it to avoid
vendor-locking you in to any cloud ecosystem.
In Chapter 11, we will explore in more depth how to leverage an
orchestrator to implement MLOps best practices. But now that we
understand ZenML, what it is helpful for, and how to use it, let’s
move on to the experiment tracker.
Comet ML: experiment tracker
Training ML models is an entirely iterative and experimental process.
Unlike traditional software development, it involves running multiple
parallel experiments, comparing them based on predefined metrics,
and deciding which one should advance to production. An
experiment tracking tool allows you to log all the necessary
information, such as metrics and visual representations of your

## Page 108

model predictions, to compare all your experiments and quickly
select the best model. Our LLM project is no exception.
As illustrated in Figure 2.11, we used Comet to track metrics such as
training and evaluation loss or the value of the gradient norm across
all our experiments.
Figure 2.11: Comet ML training metrics example
Using an experiment tracker, you can go beyond training and
evaluation metrics and log your training hyperparameters to track
different configurations between experiments.
It also logs out-of-the-box system metrics such as GPU, CPU, or
memory utilization to give you a clear picture of what resources you

## Page 109

need during training and where potential bottlenecks slow down your
training, as seen in Figure 2.12.
Figure 2.12: Comet ML system metrics example
You don’t have to set up Comet locally. We will use their online
version for free without any constraints throughout this book. Also, if
you want to look more in-depth into the Comet ML experiment
tracker, we made the training experiments tracked with Comet ML
public while fine-tuning our LLM Twin models. You can access them
here: https://www.comet.com/mlabonne/llm-twin-
training/view/new/panels.
Other popular experiment trackers are W&B, MLflow, and Neptune.
We’ve worked with all of them and can state that they all have mostly

## Page 110

the same features, but Comet ML differentiates itself through its ease
of use and intuitive interface. Let’s move on to the final piece of the
MLOps puzzle: Opik for prompt monitoring.
Opik: prompt monitoring
You cannot use standard tools and techniques when logging and
monitoring prompts. The reason for this is complicated. We will dig
into it in Chapter 11. However, to quickly give you some
understanding, you cannot use standard logging tools as prompts
are complex and unstructured chains.
When interacting with an LLM application, you chain multiple input
prompts and the generated output into a trace, where one prompt
depends on previous prompts.
Thus, instead of plain text logs, you need an intuitive way to group
these traces into a specialized dashboard that makes debugging and
monitoring traces of prompts easier.
We used Opik, an open-source tool made by Comet, as our prompt
monitoring tool because it follows Comet’s philosophy of simplicity
and ease of use, which is currently relatively rare in the LLM
landscape. Other options offering similar features are Langfuse
(open source, https://langfuse.com), Galileo (not open source,
rungalileo.io), and LangSmith (not open source,

## Page 111

https://www.langchain.com/langsmith), but we found their
solutions more cumbersome to use and implement. Opik, along with
its serverless option, also provides a free open-source version that
you have complete control over. You can read more on Opik at
https://github.com/comet-ml/opik.
Databases for storing unstructured
and vector data
We also want to present the NoSQL and vector databases we will
use within our examples. When working locally, they are already
integrated through Docker. Thus, when running poetry poe
local-infrastructure-up , as instructed a few sections above,
local images of Docker for both databases will be pulled and run on
your machine. Also, when deploying the project, we will show you
how to use their serverless option and integrate it with the rest of the
LLM Twin project.
MongoDB: NoSQL database
MongoDB is one of today’s most popular, robust, fast, and feature-
rich NoSQL databases. It integrates well with most cloud
ecosystems, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Databricks.
Thus, using MongoDB as our NoSQL database was a no-brainer.

## Page 112

When we wrote this book, MongoDB was used by big players such
as Novo Nordisk, Delivery Hero, Okta, and Volvo. This widespread
adoption suggests that MongoDB will remain a leading NoSQL
database for a long time.
We use MongoDB as a NoSQL database to store the raw data we
collect from the internet before processing it and pushing it into the
vector database. As we work with unstructured text data, the
flexibility of the NoSQL database fits like a charm.
Qdrant: vector database
Qdrant (https://qdrant.tech/) is one of the most popular, robust,
and feature-rich vector databases. We could have used almost any
vector database for our small MVP, but we wanted to pick something
light and likely to be used in the industry for many years to come.
We will use Qdrant to store the data from MongoDB after it’s
processed and transformed for GenAI usability.
Qdrant is used by big players such as X (formerly Twitter), Disney,
Microsoft, Discord, and Johnson & Johnson. Thus, it is highly
probable that Qdrant will remain in the vector database game for a
long time.

## Page 113

While writing the book, other popular options were Milvus, Redis,
Weaviate, Pinecone, Chroma, and pgvector (a PostgreSQL plugin
for vector indexes). We found that Qdrant offers the best trade-off
between RPS, latency, and index time, making it a solid choice for
many generative AI applications.
Comparing all the vector databases in detail could be a chapter in
itself. We don’t want to do that here. Still, if curious, you can check
the Vector DB Comparison resource from Superlinked at
https://superlinked.com/vector-db-comparison, which
compares all the top vector databases in terms of everything you can
think about, from the license and release year to database features,
embedding models, and frameworks supported.
Preparing for AWS
This last part of the chapter will focus on setting up an AWS account
(if you don’t already have one), an AWS access key, and the CLI.
Also, we will look into what SageMaker is and why we use it.
We picked AWS as our cloud provider because it’s the most popular
out there and the cloud in which we (the writers) have the most
experience. The reality is that other big cloud providers, such as
GCP or Azure, offer similar services. Thus, depending on your
specific application, there is always a trade-off between development
time (in which you have the most experience), features, and costs.

## Page 114

But for our MVP, AWS, it’s the perfect option as it provides robust
features for everything we need, such as S3 (object storage), ECR
(container registry), and SageMaker (compute for training and
inference).
Setting up an AWS account, an access key, and
the CLI
As AWS could change its UI/UX, the best way to instruct you on how
to create an AWS account is by redirecting you to their official
tutorial:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/m
anage-acct-creating.html.
After successfully creating an AWS account, you can access the
AWS console at http://console.aws.amazon.com. Select Sign in
using root user email (found under the Sign in button), then enter
your account’s email address and password.
Next, we must generate access keys to access AWS
programmatically. The best option to do so is first to create an IAM
user with administrative access as described in this AWS official
tutorial:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/setting-
up.html

## Page 115

For production accounts, it is best practice to grant permissions with
a policy of least privilege, giving each user only the permissions they
require to perform their role. However, to simplify the setup of our
test account, we will use the AdministratorAccess managed
policy, which gives our user full access, as explained in the tutorial
above and illustrated in Figure 2.13.
Figure 2.13: IAM user permission policies example
Next, you have to create an access key for the IAM user you just
created using the following tutorial:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_cre
dentials_access-keys.html.
The access keys will look as follows:
aws_access_key_id = <your_access_key_id>
aws_secret_access_key = <your_secret_access_key>

## Page 116

Just be careful to store them somewhere safe, as you won’t be able
to access them after you create them. Also, be cautious with who
you share them, as they could be used to access your AWS account
and manipulate various AWS resources.
The last step is to install the AWS CLI and configure it with your
newly created access keys. You can install the AWS CLI using the
following link:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/gettin
g-started-install.html.
After installing the AWS CLI, you can configure it by running aws
configure . Here is an example of our AWS configuration:
[default]
aws_access_key_id = *************
aws_secret_access_key = ************
region = eu-central-1
output = json
For more details on how to configure the AWS CLI, check out the
following tutorial:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-
configure-files.html.

## Page 117

Also, to configure the project with your AWS credentials, you must fill
in the following variables within your .env file:
AWS_REGION="eu-central-1" # Change it with your AW
AWS_ACCESS_KEY="<your_aws_access_key>"
AWS_SECRET_KEY="<your_aws_secret_key>"
An important note about costs associated with
hands-on tasks in this book
All the cloud services used across the book stick to
their freemium option, except AWS. Thus, if you use a
personal AWS account, you will be responsible for
AWS costs as you follow along in this book. While
some services may fall under AWS Free Tier usage,
others will not. Thus, you are responsible for checking
your billing console regularly.
Most of the costs will come when testing SageMaker
for training and inference. Based on our tests, the AWS
costs can vary between $50 and $100 using the
specifications provided in this book and repository.
See the AWS documentation on setting up billing
alarms to monitor your costs at

## Page 118

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch
/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges
_with_cloudwatch.html.
SageMaker: training and inference compute
The last topic of this chapter is understanding SageMaker and why
we decided to use it. SageMaker is an ML platform used to train and
deploy ML models. An official definition is as follows: AWS
SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service by AWS that
enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy
machine learning models at scale. It simplifies the process by
handling the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus on
developing high-quality models efficiently.
We will use SageMaker to fine-tune and operationalize our training
pipeline on clusters of GPUs and to deploy our custom LLM Twin
model as a REST API that can be accessed in real time from
anywhere in the world.
Why AWS SageMaker?
We must also discuss why we chose AWS SageMaker over simpler
and more cost-effective options, such as AWS Bedrock. First, let’s
explain Bedrock and its benefits.

## Page 119

Amazon Bedrock is a serverless solution for deploying LLMs.
Serverless means that there are no servers or infrastructure to
manage. It provides pre-trained models, which you can access
directly through API calls. When we wrote this book, they provided
support only for Mistral, Flan, Llama 2, and Llama 3 (quite a limited
list of options). You can send input data and receive predictions from
the models without managing the underlying infrastructure or
software. This approach significantly reduces the complexity and
time required to integrate AI capabilities into applications, making it
more accessible to developers with limited machine learning
expertise. However, this ease of integration comes at the cost of
limited customization options, as you’re restricted to the pre-trained
models and APIs provided by Amazon Bedrock. In terms of pricing,
Bedrock uses a simple pricing model based on the number of API
calls. This straightforward pricing structure makes it more efficient to
estimate and control costs.
Meanwhile, SageMaker provides a comprehensive platform for
building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It allows
you to customize your ML processes entirely or even use the
platform for research. That’s why SageMaker is mainly used by data
scientists and machine learning experts who know how to program,
understand machine learning concepts, and are comfortable working
with cloud platforms such as AWS. SageMaker is a double-edged
sword regarding costs, following a pay-as-you-go pricing model

## Page 120

similar to most AWS services. This means you have to pay for the
usage of computing resources, storage, and any other services
required to build your applications.
In contrast to Bedrock, even if the SageMaker endpoint is not used,
you will still pay for the deployed resources on AWS, such as online
EC2 instances. Thus, you have to design autoscaling systems that
delete unused resources. To conclude, Bedrock offers an out-of-the-
box solution that allows you to quickly deploy an API endpoint
powered by one of the available foundation models. Meanwhile,
SageMaker is a multi-functional platform enabling you to customize
your ML logic fully.
So why did we choose SageMaker over Bedrock? Bedrock would
have been an excellent solution for quickly prototyping something,
but this is a book on LLM engineering, and our goal is to dig into all
the engineering aspects that Bedrock tries to mask away. Thus, we
chose SageMaker because of its high level of customizability,
allowing us to show you all the engineering required to deploy a
model.
In reality, even SageMaker isn’t fully customizable. If you want
complete control over your deployment, use EKS, AWS’s Kubernetes
self-managed service. In this case, you have direct access to the
virtual machines, allowing you to fully customize how you build your

## Page 121

ML pipelines, how they interact, and how you manage your
resources. You could do the same thing with AWS ECS, AWS’s
version of Kubernetes. Using EKS or ECS, you could also reduce
the costs, as these services cost considerably less.
To conclude, SageMaker strikes a balance between complete control
and customization and a fully managed service that hides all the
engineering complexity behind the scenes. This balance ensures
that you have the control you need while also benefiting from the
managed service’s convenience.
Summary
In this chapter, we reviewed the core tools used across the book.
First, we understood how to install the correct version of Python that
supports our repository. Then, we looked over how to create a virtual
environment and install all the dependencies using Poetry. Finally,
we understood how to use a task execution tool like Poe the Poet to
aggregate all the commands required to run the application.
The next step was to review all the tools used to ensure MLOps best
practices, such as a model registry to share our models, an
experiment tracker to manage our training experiments, an
orchestrator to manage all our ML pipelines and artifacts, and
metadata to manage all our files and datasets. We also understood
what type of databases we need to implement the LLM Twin use

## Page 122

case. Finally, we explored the process of setting up an AWS account,
generating an access key, and configuring the AWS CLI for
programmatic access to the AWS cloud. We also gained a deep
understanding of AWS SageMaker and the reasons behind choosing
it to build our LLM Twin application.
In the next chapter, we will explore the implementation of the LLM
Twin project by starting with the data collection ETL that scrapes
posts, articles, and repositories from the internet and stores them in
a data warehouse.

Data Engineering
This chapter will begin exploring the LLM Twin project in more depth.
We will learn how to design and implement the data collection
pipeline to gather the raw data we will use in all our LLM use cases,
such as fine-tuning or inference. As this is not a book on data
engineering, we will keep this chapter short and focus only on what
is strictly necessary to collect the required raw data. Starting with
Chapter 4, we will concentrate on LLMs and GenAI, exploring its
theory and concrete implementation details.
When working on toy projects or doing research, you usually have a
static dataset with which you work. But in our LLM Twin use case,
we want to mimic a real-world scenario where we must gather and
curate the data ourselves. Thus, implementing our data pipeline will
connect the dots regarding how an end-to-end ML project works.
This chapter will explore how to design and implement an Extract,
Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline that crawls multiple social
platforms, such as Medium, Substack, or GitHub, and aggregates
the gathered data into a MongoDB data warehouse. We will show
you how to implement various crawling methods, standardize the
data, and load it into a data warehouse.

## Page 126

We will begin by designing the LLM Twin’s data collection pipeline
and explaining the architecture of the ETL pipeline. Afterward, we will
move directly to implementing the pipeline, starting with ZenML,
which will orchestrate the entire process. We will investigate the
crawler implementation and understand how to implement a
dispatcher layer that instantiates the right crawler class based on the
domain of the provided link while following software best practices.
Next, we will learn how to implement each crawler individually. Also,
we will show you how to implement a data layer on top of MongoDB
to structure all our documents and interact with the database.
Finally, we will explore how to run the data collection pipeline using
ZenML and query the collected data from MongoDB.
Thus, in this chapter, we will study the following topics:
Designing the LLM Twin’s data collection pipeline
Implementing the LLM Twin’s data collection pipeline
Gathering raw data into the data warehouse
By the end of this chapter, you will know how to design and
implement an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load raw data
ready to be ingested into the ML application.

## Page 127

Designing the LLM Twin’s data
collection pipeline
Before digging into the implementation, we must understand the LLM
Twin’s data collection ETL architecture, illustrated in Figure 3.1. We
must explore what platforms we will crawl to extract data from and
how we will design our data structures and processes. However, the
first step is understanding how our data collection pipeline maps to
an ETL process.
An ETL pipeline involves three fundamental steps:
1. We extract data from various sources. We will crawl data from
platforms like Medium, Substack, and GitHub to gather raw data.
2. We transform this data by cleaning and standardizing it into a
consistent format suitable for storage and analysis.
3. We load the transformed data into a data warehouse or database.
For our project, we use MongoDB as our NoSQL data warehouse.
Although this is not a standard approach, we will explain the
reasoning behind this choice shortly.

## Page 128

Figure 3.1: LLM Twin’s data collection ETL pipeline architecture
We want to design an ETL pipeline that inputs a user and a list of
links as input. Afterward, it crawls each link individually, standardizes
the collected content, and saves it under that specific author in a
MongoDB data warehouse.

## Page 129

Hence, the signature of the data collection pipeline will look as
follows:
Input: A list of links and their associated user (the author)
Output: A list of raw documents stored in the NoSQL data
warehouse
We will use user and author interchangeably, as in most
scenarios across the ETL pipeline, a user is the author of the
extracted content. However, within the data warehouse, we have
only a user collection.
The ETL pipeline will detect the domain of each link, based on which
it will call a specialized crawler. We implemented four different
crawlers for three different data categories, as seen in Figure 3.2.
First, we will explore the three fundamental data categories we will
work with across the book. All our collected documents can be boiled
down to an article, repository (or code), and post. It doesn’t matter
where the data comes from. We are primarily interested in the
document’s format. In most scenarios, we will have to process these
data categories differently. Thus, we created a different domain entity
for each, where each entity will have its class and collection in
MongoDB. As we save the source URL within the document’s
metadata, we will still know its source and can reference it in our
GenAI use cases.

## Page 130

Figure 3.2: The relationship between the crawlers and the data
categories
Our codebase supports four different crawlers:
Medium crawler: Used to collect data from Medium. It outputs an
article document. It logs in to Medium and crawls the HTML of the
article’s link. Then, it extracts, cleans, and normalizes the text

## Page 131

from the HTML and loads the standardized text of the article into
the NoSQL data warehouse.
Custom article crawler: It performs similar steps to the Medium
crawler but is a more generic implementation for collecting articles
from various sites. Thus, as it doesn’t implement any
particularities of any platform, it doesn’t perform the login step and
blindly gathers all the HTML from a particular link. This is enough
for articles freely available online, which you can find on Substack
and people’s blogs. We will use this crawler as a safety net when
the link’s domain isn’t associated with the other supported
crawlers. For example, when providing a Substack link, it will
default to the custom article crawler, but when providing a Medium
URL, it will use the Medium crawler.
GitHub crawler: This collects data from GitHub. It outputs a
repository document. It clones the repository, parses the
repository file tree, cleans and normalizes the files, and loads
them to the database.
LinkedIn crawler: This is used to collect data from LinkedIn. It
outputs multiple post documents. It logs in to LinkedIn, navigates
to the user’s feed, and crawls all the user’s latest posts. For each
post, it extracts its HTML, cleans and normalizes it, and loads it to
MongoDB.
In the next section, we will examine each crawler’s implementation in
detail. For now, note that each crawler accesses a specific platform

## Page 132

or site in a particular way and extracts HTML from it. Afterward, all
the crawlers parse the HTML, extract the text from it, and clean and
normalize it so it can be stored in the data warehouse under the
same interface.
By reducing all the collected data to three data categories and not
creating a new data category for every new data source, we can
easily extend this architecture to multiple data sources with minimal
effort. For example, if we want to start collecting data from X, we
only have to implement a new crawler that outputs a post document,
and that’s it. The rest of the code will remain untouched. Otherwise,
if we introduced the source dimension in the class and document
structure, we would have to add code to all downstream layers to
support any new data source. For example, we would have to
implement a new document class for each new source and adapt the
feature pipeline to support it.
For our proof of concept, crawling a few hundred documents is
enough, but if we want to scale it to a real-world product, we would
probably need more data sources to crawl from. LLMs are data-
hungry. Thus, you need thousands of documents for ideal results
instead of just a few hundred. But in many projects, it’s an excellent
strategy to implement an end-to-end project version that isn’t the
most accurate and iterate through it later. Thus, by using this
architecture, you can easily add more data sources in future

## Page 133

iterations to gather a larger dataset. More on LLM fine-tuning and
dataset size will be covered in the next chapter.
How is the ETL process connected to the feature pipeline? The
feature pipeline ingests the raw data from the MongoDB data
warehouse, cleans it further, processes it into features, and stores it
in the Qdrant vector DB to make it accessible for the LLM training
and inference pipelines. Chapter 4 provides more information on the
feature pipeline. The ETL process is independent of the feature
pipeline. The two pipelines communicate with each other strictly
through the MongoDB data warehouse. Thus, the data collection
pipeline can write data for MongoDB, and the feature pipeline can
read from it independently and on different schedules.
Why did we use MongoDB as a data warehouse? Using a
transactional database, such as MongoDB, as a data warehouse is
uncommon. However, in our use case, we are working with small
amounts of data, which MongoDB can handle. Even if we plan to
compute statistics on top of our MongoDB collections, it will work fine
at the scale of our LLM Twin’s data (hundreds of documents). We
picked MongoDB to store our raw data primarily because of the
nature of our unstructured data: text crawled from the internet. By
mainly working with unstructured text, selecting a NoSQL database
that doesn’t enforce a schema made our development easier and
faster. Also, MongoDB is stable and easy to use. Their Python SDK

## Page 134

is intuitive. They provide a Docker image that works out of the box
locally and a cloud freemium tier that is perfect for proofs of concept,
such as the LLM Twin. Thus, we can freely work with it locally and in
the cloud. However, when working with big data (millions of
documents or more), using a dedicated data warehouse such as
Snowflake or BigQuery will be ideal.
Now that we’ve understood the architecture of the LLM Twin’s data
collection pipeline, let’s move on to its implementation.
Implementing the LLM Twin’s data collection
pipeline
As we presented in Chapter 2, the entry point to each pipeline from
our LLM Twin project is a ZenML pipeline, which can be configured
at runtime through YAML files and run through the ZenML
ecosystem. Thus, let’s start by looking into the ZenML
digital_data_etl pipeline. You’ll notice that this is the same
pipeline we used as an example in Chapter 2 to illustrate ZenML. But
this time, we will dig deeper into the implementation, explaining how
the data collection works behind the scenes. After understanding
how the pipeline works, we will explore the implementation of each
crawler used to collect data from various sites and the MongoDB
documents used to store and query data from the data warehouse.

## Page 135

ZenML pipeline and steps
In the code snippet below, we can see the implementation of the
ZenML digital_data_etl pipeline, which inputs the user’s full
name and a list of links that will be crawled under that user
(considered the author of the content extracted from those links).
Within the function, we call two steps. In the first one, we look up the
user in the database based on its full name. Then, we loop through
all the links and crawl each independently. The pipeline’s
implementation is available in our repository at
pipelines/digital_data_etl.py .
from zenml import pipeline
from steps.etl import crawl_links, get_or_create_u
@pipeline
def digital_data_etl(user_full_name: str, links: l
user = get_or_create_user(user_full_name)
last_step = crawl_links(user=user, links=links
return last_step.invocation_id
Figure 3.3 shows a run of the digital_data_etl pipeline on the
ZenML dashboard. The next phase is to explore the
get_or_create_user and crawl_links ZenML steps
individually. The step implementation is available in our repository at
steps/etl .

## Page 136

Figure 3.3: Example of a digital_data_etl pipeline run from ZenML’s
dashboard
We will start with the get_or_create_user ZenML step. We begin
by importing the necessary modules and functions used throughout
the script.
from loguru import logger
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from zenml import get_step_context, step
from llm_engineering.application import utils
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import UserD

## Page 137

Next, we define the function’s signature, which takes a user’s full
name as input and retrieves an existing user or creates a new one in
the MongoDB database if it doesn’t exist:
@step
def get_or_create_user(user_full_name: str) -> Ann
Using a utility function, we split the full name into first and last
names. Then, we attempt to retrieve the user from the database or
create a new one if it doesn’t exist. We also retrieve the current step
context and add metadata about the user to the output, which will be
reflected in the metadata of the user ZenML output artifact:
logger.info(f"Getting or creating user: {user_
first_name, last_name = utils.split_user_full_
user = UserDocument.get_or_create(first_name=f
step_context = get_step_context()
step_context.add_output_metadata(output_name="
return user
Additionally, we define a helper function called _get_metadata() ,
which builds a dictionary containing the query parameters and the
retrieved user information, which will be added as metadata to the
user artifact:

## Page 138

def _get_metadata(user_full_name: str, user: UserD
return {
"query": {
"user_full_name": user_full_name,
},
"retrieved": {
"user_id": str(user.id),
"first_name": user.first_name,
"last_name": user.last_name,
},
}
We will move on to the crawl_links ZenML step, which collects
the data from the provided links. The code begins by importing
essential modules and libraries for web crawling:
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from loguru import logger
from tqdm import tqdm
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from zenml import get_step_context, step
from llm_engineering.application.crawlers.dispatch
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import UserD

## Page 139

Following the imports, the main function inputs a list of links written
by a specific author. Within this function, a crawler dispatcher is
initialized and configured to handle specific domains such as
LinkedIn, Medium, and GitHub:
@step
def crawl_links(user: UserDocument, links: list[st
dispatcher = CrawlerDispatcher.build().registe
logger.info(f"Starting to crawl {len(links)} l
The function initializes variables to store the output metadata and
count successful crawls. It then iterates over each link. It attempts to
crawl and extract data for each link, updating the count of successful
crawls and accumulating metadata about each URL:
metadata = {}
successfull_crawls = 0
for link in tqdm(links):
successfull_crawl, crawled_domain = _crawl
successfull_crawls += successfull_crawl
metadata = _add_to_metadata(metadata, craw
After processing all links, the function attaches the accumulated
metadata to the output artifact:

## Page 140

step_context = get_step_context()
step_context.add_output_metadata(output_name="
logger.info(f"Successfully crawled {successful
links.")
return links
The code includes a helper function that attempts to extract
information from each link using the appropriate crawler based on
the link’s domain. It handles any exceptions that may occur during
extraction and returns a tuple indicating the crawl’s success and the
link’s domain:
def _crawl_link(dispatcher: CrawlerDispatcher, lin
crawler = dispatcher.get_crawler(link)
crawler_domain = urlparse(link).netloc
try:
crawler.extract(link=link, user=user)
return (True, crawler_domain)
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"An error occurred while cra
return (False, crawler_domain)
Another helper function is provided to update the metadata
dictionary with the results of each crawl:

## Page 141

def _add_to_metadata(metadata: dict, domain: str,
if domain not in metadata:
metadata[domain] = {}
metadata[domain]["successful"] = metadata.get(
metadata[domain]["total"] = metadata.get(domai
return metadata
As seen in the abovementioned _crawl_link() function, the
CrawlerDispatcher class knows what crawler to initialize based
on each link’s domain. The logic is then abstracted away under the
crawler’s extract() method. Let’s zoom in on the
CrawlerDispatcher class to understand how this works fully.
The dispatcher: How do you instantiate the right
crawler?
The entry point to our crawling logic is the CrawlerDispatcher
class. As illustrated in Figure 3.4, the dispatcher acts as the
intermediate layer between the provided links and the crawlers. It
knows what crawler to associate with each URL.
The CrawlerDispatcher class knows how to extract the domain of
each link and initialize the proper crawler that collects the data from
that site. For example, if it detects the https://medium.com domain
when providing a link to an article, it will build an instance of the

## Page 142

MediumCrawler used to crawl that particular platform. With that in
mind, let’s explore the implementation of the CrawlerDispatcher
class.
All the crawling logic is available in the GitHub
repository at
llm_engineering/application/crawlers .

## Page 143

Figure 3.4: The relationship between the provided links, the
CrawlerDispatcher, and the crawlers
We begin by importing the necessary Python modules for URL
handling and regex, along with importing our crawler classes:
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from loguru import logger
from .base import BaseCrawler
from .custom_article import CustomArticleCrawler
from .github import GithubCrawler
from .linkedin import LinkedInCrawler
from .medium import MediumCrawler
The CrawlerDispatcher class is defined to manage and dispatch
appropriate crawler instances based on given URLs and their
domains. Its constructor initializes a registry to store the registered
crawlers.
class CrawlerDispatcher:
def __init__(self) -> None:
self._crawlers = {}
As we are using the builder creational pattern to instantiate and
configure the dispatcher, we define a build() class method that

## Page 144

returns an instance of the dispatcher:
@classmethod
def build(cls) -> "CrawlerDispatcher":
dispatcher = cls()
return dispatcher
The dispatcher includes methods to register crawlers for specific
platforms like Medium, LinkedIn, and GitHub. These methods use a
generic register() method under the hood to add each crawler to
the registry. By returning self, we follow the builder creational pattern
(more on the builder pattern: https://refactoring.guru/design-
patterns/builder). We can chain multiple register_*()
methods when instantiating the dispatcher as follows:
CrawlerDispatcher.build().register_linkedin().register_
medium() .
def register_medium(self) -> "CrawlerDispatche
self.register("https://medium.com", Medium
return self
def register_linkedin(self) -> "CrawlerDispatc
self.register("https://linkedin.com", Link
return self
def register_github(self) -> "CrawlerDispatche
self register("https://github com" Github

## Page 145

self.register( https://github.com , Github
return self
The generic register() method normalizes each domain to
ensure its format is consistent before it’s added as a key to the
self._crawlers registry of the dispatcher. This is a critical step, as
we will use the key of the dictionary as the domain pattern to match
future links with a crawler:
def register(self, domain: str, crawler: type[
parsed_domain = urlparse(domain)
domain = parsed_domain.netloc
self._crawlers[r"https://(www\.)?{}/*".for
Finally, the get_crawler() method determines the appropriate
crawler for a given URL by matching it against the registered
domains. If no match is found, it logs a warning and defaults to using
the CustomArticleCrawler .
def get_crawler(self, url: str) -> BaseCrawler
for pattern, crawler in self._crawlers.ite
if re.match(pattern, url):
return crawler()
else:
logger warning(f"No crawler found for

## Page 146

logger.warning(f No crawler found for
return CustomArticleCrawler()
The next step in understanding how the data collection pipeline
works is analyzing each crawler individually.
The crawlers
Before exploring each crawler’s implementation, we must present
their base class, which defines a unified interface for all the crawlers.
As shown in Figure 3.4, we can implement the dispatcher layer
because each crawler follows the same signature. Each class
implements the extract() method, allowing us to leverage OOP
techniques such as polymorphism, where we can work with abstract
objects without knowing their concrete subclass. For example, in the
_crawl_link() function from the ZenML steps, we had the
following code:
crawler = dispatcher.get_crawler(link)
crawler.extract(link=link, user=user)
Note how we called the extract() method without caring about
what specific type of crawler we instantiated. To conclude, working
with abstract interfaces ensures core reusability and ease of
extension.

## Page 147

Base classes
Now, let’s explore the BaseCrawler interface, which can be found
in the repository at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/crawlers
/base.py.
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class BaseCrawler(ABC):
model: type[NoSQLBaseDocument]
@abstractmethod
def extract(self, link: str, **kwargs) -> None
As mentioned above, the interface defines an extract() method
that takes as input a link. Also, it defines a model attribute at the
class level that represents the data category document type used to
save the extracted data into the MongoDB data warehouse. Doing
so allows us to customize each subclass with different data
categories while preserving the same attributes at the class level.
We will soon explore the NoSQLBaseDocument class when digging
into the document entities.
We also extend the BaseCrawler class with a
BaseSeleniumCrawler class, which implements reusable

## Page 148

functionality that uses Selenium to crawl various sites, such as
Medium or LinkedIn. Selenium is a tool for automating web
browsers. It’s used to interact with web pages programmatically (like
logging into LinkedIn, navigating through profiles, etc.).
Selenium can programmatically control various browsers such as
Chrome, Firefox, or Brave. For these specific platforms, we need
Selenium to manipulate the browser programmatically to log in and
scroll through the newsfeed or article before being able to extract the
entire HTML. For other sites, where we don’t have to go through the
login step or can directly load the whole page, we can extract the
HTML from a particular URL using more straightforward methods
than Selenium.
For the Selenium-based crawlers to work, you must
install Chrome on your machine (or a Chromium-based
browser such as Brave).
The code begins by setting up the necessary imports and
configurations for web crawling using Selenium and the
ChromeDriver initializer. The chromedriver_autoinstaller
ensures that the appropriate version of ChromeDriver is installed and
added to the system path, maintaining compatibility with the installed
version of your Google Chrome browser (or other Chromium-based
browser). Selenium will use the ChromeDriver to communicate with

## Page 149

the browser and open a headless session, where we can
programmatically manipulate the browser to access various URLs,
click on specific elements, such as buttons, or scroll through the
newsfeed. Using the chromedriver_autoinstaller , we ensure
we always have the correct ChromeDriver version installed that
matches our machine’s Chrome browser version.
import time
from tempfile import mkdtemp
import chromedriver_autoinstaller
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Opti
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import NoSQL
# Check if the current version of chromedriver exi
# and if it doesn't exist, download it automatical
# then add chromedriver to path
chromedriver_autoinstaller.install()
Next, we define the BaseSeleniumCrawler class for use cases
where we need Selenium to collect the data, such as collecting data
from Medium or LinkedIn.
Its constructor initializes various Chrome options to optimize
performance, enhance security, and ensure a headless browsing
environment. These options disable unnecessary features like GPU

## Page 150

rendering, extensions, and notifications, which can interfere with
automated browsing. These are standard configurations when
crawling in headless mode:
class BaseSeleniumCrawler(BaseCrawler, ABC):
def __init__(self, scroll_limit: int = 5) -> N
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
options.add_argument("--headless=new")
options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-us
options.add_argument("--log-level=3")
options.add_argument("--disable-popup-bloc
options.add_argument("--disable-notificati
options.add_argument("--disable-extensions
options.add_argument("--disable-background
options.add_argument("--ignore-certificate
options.add_argument(f"--user-data-dir={mk
options.add_argument(f"--data-path={mkdtem
options.add_argument(f"--disk-cache-dir={m
options.add_argument("--remote-debugging-p
After configuring the Chrome options, the code allows subclasses to
set any additional driver options by calling the
set_extra_driver_options() method. It then initializes the scroll

## Page 151

limit and creates a new instance of the Chrome driver with the
specified options:
self.set_extra_driver_options(options)
self.scroll_limit = scroll_limit
self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(
options=options,
)
The BaseSeleniumCrawler class includes placeholder methods for
set_extra_driver_options() and login() , which subclasses
can override to provide specific functionality. This ensures
modularity, as every platform has a different login page with a
different HTML structure:
def set_extra_driver_options(self, options: Op
pass
def login(self) -> None:
pass
Finally, the scroll_page() method implements a scrolling
mechanism to navigate through pages, such as LinkedIn, up to a
specified scroll limit. It scrolls to the bottom of the page, waits for
new content to load, and repeats the process until it reaches the end

## Page 152

of the page or the scroll limit is exceeded. This method is essential
for feeds where the content appears as the user scrolls:
def scroll_page(self) -> None:
"""Scroll through the LinkedIn page based
current_scroll = 0
last_height = self.driver.execute_script("
while True:
self.driver.execute_script("window.scr
time.sleep(5)
new_height = self.driver.execute_scrip
if new_height == last_height or (self.
break
last_height = new_height
current_scroll += 1
We’ve understood what the base classes of our crawlers look like.
Next, we will look into the implementation of the following specific
crawlers:
GitHubCrawler(BaseCrawler)
CustomArticleCrawler(BaseCrawler)
MediumCrawler(BaseSeleniumCrawler)
You can find the implementation of the above
crawlers in the GitHub repository at

## Page 153

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-Handbook/tree/main
/llm_engineering/application/crawlers.
GitHubCrawler class
The GithubCrawler class is designed to scrape GitHub
repositories, extending the functionality of the BaseCrawler . We
don’t have to log in to GitHub through the browser, as we can
leverage Git’s clone functionality. Thus, we don’t have to leverage
any Selenium functionality. Upon initialization, it sets up a list of
patterns to ignore standard files and directories found in GitHub
repositories, such as .git , .toml , .lock , and .png , ensuring
that unnecessary files are excluded from the scraping process:
class GithubCrawler(BaseCrawler):
model = RepositoryDocument
def __init__(self, ignore=(".git", ".toml", ".
super().__init__()
self._ignore = ignore
Next, we implement the extract() method, where the crawler first
checks if the repository has already been processed and stored in

## Page 154

the database. If it exists, it exits the method to prevent storing
duplicates:
def extract(self, link: str, **kwargs) -> None:
old_model = self.model.find(link=link)
if old_model is not None:
logger.info(f"Repository already exists in
return
If the repository is new, the crawler extracts the repository name
from the link. Then, it creates a temporary directory to clone the
repository to ensure that the cloned repository is cleaned up from the
local disk after it’s processed:
logger.info(f"Starting scrapping GitHub reposi
repo_name = link.rstrip("/").split("/")[-1]
local_temp = tempfile.mkdtemp()
Within a try block, the crawler changes the current working directory
to the temporary directory and executes the git clone
command in a different process:
try:
os.chdir(local_temp)

## Page 155

subprocess.run(["git", "clone", link])
After successfully cloning the repository, the crawler constructs the
path to the cloned repository. It initializes an empty dictionary used to
aggregate the content of the files in a standardized way. It walks
through the directory tree, skipping over any directories or files that
match the ignore patterns. For each relevant file, it reads the
content, removes any spaces, and stores it in the dictionary with the
file path as the key:
repo_path = os.path.join(local_temp, os.li
tree = {}
for root, _, files in os.walk(repo_path):
dir = root.replace(repo_path, "").lstr
if dir.startswith(self._ignore):
continue
for file in files:
if file.endswith(self._ignore):
continue
file_path = os.path.join(dir, file
with open(os.path.join(root, file)
tree[file_path] = f.read().rep
It then creates a new instance of the RepositoryDocument model,
populating it with the repository content, name, link, platform

## Page 156

information, and author details. The instance is then saved to
MongoDB:
user = kwargs["user"]
instance = self.model(
content=tree,
name=repo_name,
link=link,
platform="github",
author_id=user.id,
author_full_name=user.full_name,
)
instance.save()
Finally, whether the scraping succeeds or an exception occurs, the
crawler ensures that the temporary directory is removed to clean up
any resources used during the process:
except Exception:
raise
finally:
shutil.rmtree(local_temp)
logger.info(f"Finished scrapping GitHub reposi
CustomArticleCrawler class

## Page 157

The CustomArticleCrawler class takes a different approach to
collecting data from the internet. It leverages the AsyncHtmlLoader
class to read the entire HTML from a link and the
Html2TextTransformer class to extract the text from that HTML.
Both classes are made available by the langchain_community
Python package, as seen below, where we import all the necessary
Python modules:
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from langchain_community.document_loaders import A
from langchain_community.document_transformers.htm
from loguru import logger
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import Artic
from .base import BaseCrawler
Next, we define the CustomArticleCrawler class, which inherits
from BaseCrawler . As before, we don’t need to log in or use the
scrolling functionality provided by Selenium. In the extract
method, we first check if the article exists in the database to avoid
duplicating content:
class CustomArticleCrawler(BaseCrawler):
model = ArticleDocument
def extract(self, link: str, **kwargs) -> None
old model = self model find(link=link)

## Page 158

old_model = self.model.find(link=link)
if old_model is not None:
logger.info(f"Article already exists i
return
If the article doesn’t exist, we proceed to scrape it. We use the
AsyncHtmlLoader class to load the HTML from the provided link.
After, we transform it into plain text using the
Html2TextTransformer class, which returns a list of documents.
We are only interested in the first document. As we delegate the
whole logic to these two classes, we don’t control how the content is
extracted and parsed. That’s why we used this class as a fallback
system for domains where we don’t have anything custom
implemented. These two classes follow the LangChain paradigm,
which provides high-level functionality that works decently in most
scenarios. It is fast to implement but hard to customize. That is one
of the reasons why many developers avoid using LangChain in
production use cases:
logger.info(f"Starting scrapping article:
loader = AsyncHtmlLoader([link])
docs = loader.load()
html2text = Html2TextTransformer()
docs_transformed = html2text.transform_doc
doc_transformed = docs_transformed[0]

## Page 159

We get the page content from the extracted document, plus relevant
metadata such as the title , subtitle , content , and
language :
content = {
"Title": doc_transformed.metadata.get(
"Subtitle": doc_transformed.metadata.g
"Content": doc_transformed.page_conten
"language": doc_transformed.metadata.g
}
Next, we parse the URL to determine the platform (or domain) from
which the article was scraped:
parsed_url = urlparse(link)
platform = parsed_url.netloc
We then create a new instance of the article model, populating it with
the extracted content. Finally, we save this instance to the MongoDB
data warehouse:
user = kwargs["user"]
instance = self.model(
content=content

## Page 160

content=content,
link=link,
platform=platform,
author_id=user.id,
author_full_name=user.full_name,
)
instance.save()
logger.info(f"Finished scrapping custom ar
So far, we have seen how to crawl GitHub repositories and random
sites using LangChain utility functions. Lastly, we must explore a
crawler using Selenium to manipulate the browser programmatically.
Thus, we will continue with the MediumCrawler implementation.
MediumCrawler class
The code begins by importing essential libraries and defining the
MediumCrawler class, which inherits from
BaseSeleniumCrawler :
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from loguru import logger
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import Artic
from .base import BaseSeleniumCrawler
class MediumCrawler(BaseSeleniumCrawler):
model = ArticleDocument

## Page 161

Within the MediumCrawler class, we leverage the
set_extra_driver_options() method to extend the default driver
options used by Selenium:
def set_extra_driver_options(self, options) ->
options.add_argument(r"--profile-directory
The extract() method implements the core functionality, first
checking whether the article exists in the database to prevent
duplicate entries.
If the article is new, the method proceeds to navigate to the article’s
link and scroll through the page to ensure all content is loaded:
def extract(self, link: str, **kwargs) -> None
old_model = self.model.find(link=link)
if old_model is not None:
logger.info(f"Article already exists i
return
logger.info(f"Starting scrapping Medium ar
self.driver.get(link)
self.scroll_page()

## Page 162

After fully loading the page, the method uses BeautifulSoup to
parse the HTML content and extract the article’s title, subtitle, and
full text. BeautifulSoup is a popular Python library for web
scraping and parsing HTML or XML documents. Thus, we used it to
extract all the HTML elements we needed from the HTML accessed
with Selenium. Finally, we aggregate everything into a dictionary:
soup = BeautifulSoup(self.driver.page_sour
title = soup.find_all("h1", class_="pw-pos
subtitle = soup.find_all("h2", class_="pw-
data = {
"Title": title[0].string if title else
"Subtitle": subtitle[0].string if subt
"Content": soup.get_text(),
}
Finally, the method closes the WebDriver to free up resources. It
then creates a new ArticleDocument instance, populates it with
the extracted content and user information provided via kwargs ,
and saves it to the database:
self.driver.close()
user = kwargs["user"]
instance = self.model(
platform="medium",
content=data

## Page 163

content=data,
link=link,
author_id=user.id,
author_full_name=user.full_name,
)
instance.save()
logger.info(f"Successfully scraped and sav
With that, we conclude the MediumCrawler implementation. The
LinkedIn crawler follows a similar pattern to the Medium one, where
it uses Selenium to log in and access the feed of a user’s latest
posts. Then, it extracts the posts and scrolls through the feed to load
the next page until a limit is hit. You can check the full
implementation in our repository at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/crawlers
/linkedin.py.
With the rise of LLMs, collecting data from the internet has become a
critical step in many real-world AI applications. Hence, more high-
level tools have appeared in the Python ecosystem, such as Scrapy
(https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy), which crawls websites
and extracts structured data from their pages, and Crawl4AI
(https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai), which is highly
specialized in crawling data for LLMs and AI applications.

## Page 164

In this section, we’ve looked at implementing three types of crawlers:
one that leverages the git executable in a subprocess to clone
GitHub repositories, one that uses LangChain utilities to extract the
HTML of a single web page, and one that leverages Selenium for
more complex scenarios where we have to navigate through the
login page, scroll the article to load the entire HTML, and extract it
into text format. The last step is understanding how the document
classes we’ve used across the chapter, such as the
ArticleDocument , work.
The NoSQL data warehouse documents
We had to implement three document classes to structure our data
categories. These classes define the specific attributes we require
for a document, such as the content, author, and source link. It is
best practice to structure your data in classes instead of dictionaries,
as the attributes we expect for each item are more verbose, reducing
run errors. For example, when accessing a value from a Python
dictionary, we can never be sure it is present or its type is current. By
wrapping our data items with classes, we can ensure each attribute
is as expected.
By leveraging Python packages such as Pydantic, we have out-of-
the-box type validation, which ensures consistency in our datasets.

## Page 165

Thus, we modeled the data categories as the following document
classes, which we already used in the code up until point:
ArticleDocument class
PostDocument class
RepositoryDocument class
These are not simple Python data classes or Pydantic models. They
support read and write operations on top of the MongoDB data
warehouse. To inject the read-and-write functionality into all the
document classes without repeating any code, we used the Object-
Document Mapping (ODM) software pattern, which is based on the
object-relational mapping (ORM) pattern. Thus, let’s first explore
ORM, then move to ODM, and, finally, dig into our custom ODM
implementation and document classes.
The ORM and ODM software
patterns
Before we talk about software patterns, let’s see what ORM is. It’s a
technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database
using an object-oriented paradigm. Instead of writing SQL or API-
specific queries, you encapsulate all the complexity under an ORM
class that knows how to handle all the database operations, most
commonly CRUD operations. Thus, working with ORM removes the

## Page 166

need to handle the database operations manually and reduces the
need to write boilerplate code manually. An ORM interacts with a
SQL database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Most modern Python applications use ORMs when interacting with
the database. Even though SQL is still a popular choice in the data
world, you rarely see raw SQL queries in Python backend
components. The most popular Python ORM is SQLAlchemy
(https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). Also, with the rise of FastAPI,
SQLModel is (https://github.com/fastapi/sqlmodel) a
common choice, which is a wrapper over SQLAlchemy that makes
the integration easier with FastAPI.
For example, using SQLAlchemy, we defined a User ORM with the
ID and name fields. The User ORM is mapped to the users table
within the SQL database. Thus, when we create a new user and
commit it to the database, it is automatically saved to the users
table. The same applies to all the CRUD operations on top of the
User class.
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, cr
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, sessi
Base = declarative_base()
# Define a class that maps to the users table.
class User(Base):
tablename = "users"

## Page 167

__tablename__ = users
id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
name = Column(String)
Using the User ORM, we can quickly insert or query users directly
from Python without writing a line of SQL. Note that an ORM usually
supports all CRUD operations. Here is a code snippet that shows
how to save an instance of the User ORM to a SQLite database:
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
# Create a session used to interact with the datab
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
# Add a new user.
new_user = User(name="Alice")
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()
Also, this is how we can query a user from the users SQLite table:
user = session.query(User).first()
if user:
print(f"User ID: {user.id}")
print(f"User name: {user.name}")

## Page 168

Find the entire script and how to run it in the GitHub
repository at code_snippets/03_orm.py .
The ODM pattern is extremely similar to ORM, but instead of working
with SQL databases and tables, it works with NoSQL databases
(such as MongoDB) and unstructured collections. As we work with
NoSQL databases, the data structure is centered on collections,
which store JSON-like documents rather than rows in tables.
To conclude, ODM simplifies working with document-based NoSQL
databases and maps object-oriented code to JSON-like documents.
We will implement a light ODM module on top of MongoDB to fully
understand how ODM works.
Implementing the ODM class
This section will explore how to implement an ODM class from
scratch. This is an excellent exercise to learn how ODM works and
sharpen our skills in writing modular and reusable Python classes.
Hence, we will implement a base ODM class called
NoSQLBaseDocument , from which all the other documents will
inherit to interact with the MongoDB data warehouse.
The class can be found in our repository at
llm_engineering/domain/base/nosql.py .

## Page 169

The code starts by importing essential modules and setting up the
database connection. Through the _database variable, we
establish a connection to the database specified in the settings,
which is by default called twin :
import uuid
from abc import ABC
from typing import Generic, Type, TypeVar
from loguru import logger
from pydantic import UUID4, BaseModel, Field
from pymongo import errors
from llm_engineering.domain.exceptions import Impr
from llm_engineering.infrastructure.db.mongo impor
from llm_engineering.settings import settings
_database = connection.get_database(settings.DATAB
Next, we define a type variable T bound to the
NoSQLBaseDocument class. The variable leverages Python’s
generic module, allowing us to generalize the class’s types. For
example, when we implement the ArticleDocument class, which
will inherit from the NoSQLBaseDocument class, all the instances
where T was used will be replaced with the ArticleDocument
type when analyzing the signature of functions (more on Python
generics: https://realpython.com/python312-typing).

## Page 170

The NoSQLBaseDocument class is then declared as an abstract
base class inheriting from Pydantic’s BaseModel, Python’s Generic
(which provides the functionality described earlier), and ABC
(making the class abstract) classes. This class serves as the
foundational ODM class:
T = TypeVar("T", bound="NoSQLBaseDocument")
class NoSQLBaseDocument(BaseModel, Generic[T], ABC
Within the NoSQLBaseDocument class, an id field is defined as a
UUID4, with a default factory generating a unique UUID. The class
also implements the __eq__ and __hash__ methods to allow
instances to be compared and used in hashed collections like sets or
as dictionary keys based on their unique id attribute:
id: UUID4 = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4)
def __eq__(self, value: object) -> bool:
if not isinstance(value, self.__class__):
return False
return self.id == value.id
def __hash__(self) -> int:
return hash(self.id)

## Page 171

The class provides methods for converting between MongoDB
documents and class instances. The from_mongo() class method
transforms a dictionary retrieved from MongoDB into an instance of
the class. The to_mongo() instance method converts the model
instance into a dictionary suitable for MongoDB insertion:
@classmethod
def from_mongo(cls: Type[T], data: dict) -> T:
if not data:
raise ValueError("Data is empty.")
id = data.pop("_id")
return cls(**dict(data, id=id))
def to_mongo(self: T, **kwargs) -> dict:
exclude_unset = kwargs.pop("exclude_unset", Fa
by_alias = kwargs.pop("by_alias", True)
parsed = self.model_dump(exclude_unset=exclude
if "_id" not in parsed and "id" in parsed:
parsed["_id"] = str(parsed.pop("id"))
for key, value in parsed.items():
if isinstance(value, uuid.UUID):
parsed[key] = str(value)
return parsed
The save() method allows an instance of the model to be inserted
into a MongoDB collection. It retrieves the appropriate collection,
converts the instance into a MongoDB-compatible document

## Page 172

leveraging the to_mongo() method described above, and attempts
to insert it into the database, handling any write errors that may
occur:
def save(self: T, **kwargs) -> T | None:
collection = _database[self.get_collection_nam
try:
collection.insert_one(self.to_mongo(**kwar
return self
except errors.WriteError:
logger.exception("Failed to insert documen
return None
The get_or_create() class method attempts to find a document
in the database matching the provided filter options. If a matching
document is found, it is converted into an instance of the class. If
not, a new instance is created with the filter options as its initial data
and saved to the database:
@classmethod
def get_or_create(cls: Type[T], **filter_options)
collection = _database[cls.get_collection_name
try:
instance = collection.find_one(filter_opti
if instance:
return cls from mongo(instance)

## Page 173

return cls.from_mongo(instance)
new_instance = cls(**filter_options)
new_instance = new_instance.save()
return new_instance
except errors.OperationFailure:
logger.exception(f"Failed to retrieve docu
raise
The bulk_insert() class method allows multiple documents to be
inserted into the database at once:
@classmethod
def bulk_insert(cls: Type[T], documents: list[T],
collection = _database[cls.get_collection_name
try:
collection.insert_many([doc.to_mongo(**kwa
return True
except (errors.WriteError, errors.BulkWriteErr
logger.error(f"Failed to insert documents of type
return False
The find() class method searches for a single document in the
database that matches the given filter options:

## Page 174

@classmethod
def find(cls: Type[T], **filter_options) -> T | No
collection = _database[cls.get_collection_name
try:
instance = collection.find_one(filter_opti
if instance:
return cls.from_mongo(instance)
return None
except errors.OperationFailure:
logger.error("Failed to retrieve document.
return None
Similarly, the bulk_find() class method retrieves multiple
documents matching the filter options. It converts each retrieved
MongoDB document into a model instance, collecting them into a
list:
@classmethod
def bulk_find(cls: Type[T], **filter_options) -> l
collection = _database[cls.get_collection_name
try:
instances = collection.find(filter_options
return [document for instance in instances
except errors.OperationFailure:
logger.error("Failed to retrieve document.
return []

## Page 175

Finally, the get_collection_name() class method determines the
name of the MongoDB collection associated with the class. It
expects the class to have a nested Settings class with a name
attribute specifying the collection name. If this configuration is
missing, an ImproperlyConfigured exception will be raised
specifying that the subclass should define a nested Settings
class:
@classmethod
def get_collection_name(cls: Type[T]) -> str:
if not hasattr(cls, "Settings") or not hasattr
raise ImproperlyConfigured(
"Document should define an Settings co
)
return cls.Settings.name
We can configure each subclass using the nested Settings class,
such as defining the collection name, or anything else specific to that
subclass. Within the Python ecosystem, there is an ODM
implementation on top of MongoDB, called mongoengine , which
you can find on GitHub. It follows a pattern similar to ours but more
comprehensive. We implemented it by ourselves, as it was an
excellent exercise to practice writing modular and generic code

## Page 176

following best OOP principles, which are essential for implementing
production-level code.
Data categories and user document
classes
The last piece of the puzzle is to see the implementation of the
subclasses that inherit from the NoSQLBaseDocument base class.
These are the concrete classes that define our data categories.
You’ve seen these classes used across the chapter when working
with articles, repositories, and posts within the crawler classes.
We begin by importing the essential Python modules and the ODM
base class:
from abc import ABC
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import UUID4, Field
from .base import NoSQLBaseDocument
from .types import DataCategory
We define an enum class, where we centralize all our data category
types. These variables will act as constants in configuring all our
ODM classes throughout the book.

## Page 177

The class can be found in the repository at
llm_engineering/domain/types.py .
from enum import StrEnum
class DataCategory(StrEnum):
PROMPT = "prompt"
QUERIES = "queries"
INSTRUCT_DATASET_SAMPLES = "instruct_dataset_s
INSTRUCT_DATASET = "instruct_dataset"
PREFERENCE_DATASET_SAMPLES = "preference_datas
PREFERENCE_DATASET = "preference_dataset"
POSTS = "posts"
ARTICLES = "articles"
REPOSITORIES = "repositories"
The Document class is introduced as an abstract base model for
other documents on top of the NoSQLBaseDocument ODM class. It
includes common attributes like content, platform, and author details,
providing a standardized structure for documents that will inherit
from it:
class Document(NoSQLBaseDocument, ABC):
content: dict
platform: str
author id: UUID4 = Field(alias="author id")

## Page 178

author_id: UUID4 = Field(alias= author_id )
author_full_name: str = Field(alias="author_fu
Finally, specific document types are defined by extending the
Document class. The RepositoryDocument , PostDocument , and
ArticleDocument classes represent different categories of data,
each with unique fields and settings that specify their respective
collection names in the database:
class RepositoryDocument(Document):
name: str
link: str
class Settings:
name = DataCategory.REPOSITORIES
class PostDocument(Document):
image: Optional[str] = None
link: str | None = None
class Settings:
name = DataCategory.POSTS
class ArticleDocument(Document):
link: str
class Settings:
name = DataCategory.ARTICLES
Finally, we define the UserDocument class, which is used to store
and query all the users from the LLM Twin project:

## Page 179

class UserDocument(NoSQLBaseDocument):
first_name: str
last_name: str
class Settings:
name = "users"
@property
def full_name(self):
return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name
By implementing the NoSQLBaseDocument ODM class, we had to
focus solely on the fields and specific functionality of each document
or domain entity. All the CRUD functionality is delegated to the
parent class. Also, by leveraging Pydantic to define the fields, we
have out-of-the-box type validation. For example, when creating an
instance of the ArticleDocument class, if the provided link is
None or not a string, it will throw an error signaling that the data is
invalid.
With that, we’ve finished implementing our data collection pipeline,
starting with the ZenML components. Then, we looked into the
implementation of the crawlers and, finally, wrapped it up with the
ODM class and data category documents. The last step is to run the
data collection pipeline and ingest raw data into the MongoDB data
warehouse.

## Page 180

Gathering raw data into the data
warehouse
ZenML orchestrates the data collection pipeline. Thus, leveraging
ZenML, the data collection pipeline can be run manually, scheduled,
or triggered by specific events. Here, we will show you how to run it
manually, while we will discuss the other scenarios in Chapter 11
when digging deeper into MLOps.
We configured a different pipeline run for each author. We provided a
ZenML configuration file for Paul Iusztin’s or Maxime Labonne’s
data. To call the data collection pipeline to collect Maxime’s data, for
example, you can run the following CLI command:
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl-maxime
That will call the pipeline with the following ZenML YAML
configuration file:
parameters:
user_full_name: Maxime Labonne # [First Name(s)]
links:
# Personal Blog

… # More Substack links
In Figure 3.3 earlier, we saw the pipeline’s run DAG and details in
ZenML’s dashboard. Meanwhile, Figure 3.5 shows the user output
artifact generated by this data collection pipeline. You can inspect
the query user_full_name and the retrieved user from the
MongoDB database, for which we collected the links in this specific
run.

## Page 182

Figure 3.5: Example of the user output artifact after running the data
collection pipeline using Maxime’s configuration file
Also, in Figure 3.6, you can observe the crawled_links output
artifact, which lists all the domains from which we collected data, the
total number of links crawled for each domain, and the number of
successfully collected links.
We want to highlight again the power of these artifacts, as they trace
each pipeline’s results and metadata, making it extremely easy to
monitor and debug each pipeline run individually.

## Page 183

Figure 3.6: Example of the crawled_links output artifact after running
the data collection pipeline using Maxime’s configuration file
Now, we can download the crawled_links artifact anywhere in our
code by running the following code, where the ID of the artifact can
be found in ZenML and is unique for every artifact version:

## Page 184

from zenml.client import Client
artifact = Client().get_artifact_version('8349ce09
loaded_artifact = artifact.load()
For example, we can easily run the same data collection pipeline but
with Paul Iusztin’s YAML configuration, listed below:
parameters:
user_full_name: Paul Iusztin # [First Name(s)] [
links:
# Medium

- https://decodingml.substack.com/p/real-time-
- https://decodingml.substack.com/p/building-m
- https://decodingml.substack.com/p/reduce-you
… # More Substack links
To run the pipeline using Paul’s configuration, we call the following
poe command:
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl-paul

## Page 185

That, under the hood, calls the following CLI command that
references Paul’s config file:
poetry run python -m tools.run --run-etl --no-cach
You can find all the configs in the repository in the configs/
directory. Also, using poe , we configured a command that calls the
data collection pipeline for all the supported authors:
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl
We can easily query the MongoDB data warehouse using our ODM
classes. For example, let’s query all the articles collected for Paul
Iusztin:
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import Artic
user = UserDocument.get_or_create(first_name="Paul
articles = ArticleDocument.bulk_find(author_id=str
print(f"User ID: {user.id}")
print(f"User name: {user.first_name} {user.last_na
print(f"Number of articles: {len(articles)}")
print("First article link:", articles[0].link)
The output of the code from above is:

## Page 186

User ID: 900fec95-d621-4315-84c6-52e5229e0b96
User name: Paul Iusztin
Number of articles: 50
First article link: https://medium.com/decodingml/
With only two lines of code, we can query and filter our MongoDB
data warehouse using any ODM defined within our project.
Also, to ensure that your data collection pipeline works as expected,
you can search your MongoDB collections using your IDE’s
MongoDB plugin, which you must install separately. For example,
you can use this plugin for VSCode:
https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/vs-code. For other
IDEs, you can use similar plugins or external NoSQL visualization
tools. After connecting to the MongoDB visualization tool, you can
connect to our local database using the following URI:
mongodb://llm_engineering:llm_engineering@127.0.0.1:27
017 . For a cloud MongoDB cluster, you must change the URI, which
we will explore in Chapter 11.
And just like that, you’ve learned how to run the data collection
pipeline with different ZenML configs and how to visualize the output
artifacts of each run. We also looked at how to query the data
warehouse for a particular data category and author. Thus, we’ve

## Page 187

finalized our data engineering chapter and can move to the
conclusion.
Troubleshooting
The raw data stored in the MongoDB database is central to all future
steps. Thus, if you haven’t successfully run the code from this
chapter due to any issues with the crawlers, this section provides
solutions for fixing potential issues to allow you to move forward.
Selenium issues
It is a well-known issue that running Selenium can cause problems
due to issues with the browser driver, such as the ChromeDriver .
Thus, if the crawlers that use Selenium, such as the
MediumCrawler , fail due to problems with your ChromeDriver ,
you can easily bypass this by commenting out the Medium links
added to the data collection YAML configs. To do so, go to the
configs/ directory and find all the YAML files that start with
digital_data_etl_* , such as
digital_data_etl_maxime_labonne.yaml . Open them and
comment on all the Medium-related URLs, as illustrated in Figure
3.7. You can leave out the Substack or personal blog URLs as these
use the CustomArticleCrawler , which is not dependent on
Selenium.

## Page 188

Figure 3.7: Fix Selenium issues when crawling raw data
Import our backed-up data
If nothing works, there is the possibility of populating the MongoDB
database with your backed-up data saved under the
data/data_warehouse_raw_data directory . This will allow you
to proceed to the fine-tuning and inference sections without running
the data collection ETL code. To import all the data within this
directory, run:
poetry poe run-import-data-warehouse-from-json

## Page 189

After running the CLI command from above, you will have a one-to-
one replica of the dataset we used while developing the code. To
ensure the import is completed successfully, you should have 88
articles and 3 users in your MongoDB database.
Summary
In this chapter, we’ve learned how to design and build the data
collection pipeline for the LLM Twin use case. Instead of relying on
static datasets, we collected our custom data to mimic real-world
situations, preparing us for real-world challenges in building AI
systems.
First, we examined the architecture of LLM Twin’s data collection
pipeline, which functions as an ETL process. Next, we started
digging into the pipeline implementation. We began by
understanding how we can orchestrate the pipeline using ZenML.
Then, we looked into the crawler implementation. We learned how to
crawl data in three ways: using CLI commands in subprocesses or
using utility functions from LangChain or Selenium to build custom
logic that programmatically manipulates the browser. Finally, we
looked into how to build our own ODM class, which we used to
define our document class hierarchy, which contains entities such as
articles, posts, and repositories.

## Page 190

At the end of the chapter, we learned how to run ZenML pipelines
with different YAML configuration files and explore the results in the
dashboard. We also saw how to interact with the MongoDB data
warehouse through the ODM classes.
In the next chapter, we will cover the key steps of the RAG feature
pipeline, including chunking and embedding documents, ingesting
these documents into a vector DB, and applying pre-retrieval
optimizations to improve performance. We will also set up the
necessary infrastructure programmatically using Pulumi and
conclude by deploying the RAG ingestion pipeline to AWS.

RAG Feature Pipeline
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is fundamental in most
generative AI applications. RAG’s core responsibility is to inject
custom data into the large language model (LLM) to perform a
given action (e.g., summarize, reformulate, and extract the injected
data). You often want to use the LLM on data it wasn’t trained on
(e.g., private or new data). As fine-tuning an LLM is a highly costly
operation, RAG is a compelling strategy that bypasses the need for
constant fine-tuning to access that new data.
We will start this chapter with a theoretical part that focuses on the
fundamentals of RAG and how it works. We will then walk you
through all the components of a naïve RAG system: chunking,
embedding, and vector DBs. Ultimately, we will present various
optimizations used for an advanced RAG system. Then, we will
continue exploring LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline architecture. At
this step, we will apply all the theoretical aspects we discussed at the
beginning of the chapter. Finally, we will go through a practical
example by implementing the LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline
based on the system design described throughout the book.
The main sections of this chapter are:

An overview of advanced RAG
Exploring the LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline architecture
Implementing the LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline
By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear and comprehensive
understanding of what RAG is and how it is applied to our LLM Twin
use case.
Understanding RAG
RAG enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models
with information fetched from external sources. It is a technique
complementary to the internal knowledge of the LLMs. Before going
into the details, let’s understand what RAG stands for:
Retrieval: Search for relevant data
Augmented: Add the data as context to the prompt
Generation: Use the augmented prompt with an LLM for
generation
Any LLM is bound to understand the data it was trained on,
sometimes called parameterized knowledge. Thus, even if the LLM
can perfectly answer what happened in the past, it won’t have
access to the newest data or any other external sources on which it
wasn’t trained.

## Page 194

Let’s take the most powerful model from OpenAI as an example,
which, in the summer of 2024, is GPT-4o. The model is trained on
data up to October 2023. Thus, if we ask what happened during the
2020 pandemic, it can be answered perfectly due to its parametrized
knowledge. However, it will not know the answer if we ask about the
2024 European Football Championship results due to its bounded
parametrized knowledge. Another scenario is that it will start
confidently hallucinating and provide a faulty answer.
RAG overcomes these two limitations of LLMs. It provides access to
external or latest data and prevents hallucinations, enhancing
generative AI models’ accuracy and reliability.
Why use RAG?
We briefly explained the importance of using RAG in generative AI
applications earlier. Now, we will dig deeper into the “why,” following
which we will focus on what a naïve RAG framework looks like.
For now, to get an intuition about RAG, you have to know that when
using RAG, we inject the necessary information into the prompt to
answer the initial user question. After that, we pass the augmented
prompt to the LLM for the final answer. Now, the LLM will use the
additional context to answer the user question.
There are two fundamental problems that RAG solves:

## Page 195

Hallucinations
Old or private information
Hallucinations
If a chatbot without RAG is asked a question about something it
wasn’t trained on, there is a high chance that it will give you a
confident answer about something that isn’t true. Let’s take the 2024
European Football Championship as an example. If the model is
trained up to October 2023 and we ask it something about the
tournament, it will most likely come up with a random answer that is
hard to differentiate between reality and truth. Even if the LLM
doesn’t hallucinate all the time, it raises concerns about the
trustworthiness of its answers. Thus, we must ask ourselves: “When
can we trust the LLM’s answers?” and “How can we evaluate if the
answers are correct?”.
By introducing RAG, we enforce the LLM to always answer solely
based on the introduced context. The LLM will act as the reasoning
engine, while the additional information added through RAG will act
as the single source of truth for the generated answer. By doing so,
we can quickly evaluate if the LLM’s answer is based on the external
data or not.
Old information

## Page 196

Any LLM is trained or fine-tuned on a subset of the total world
knowledge dataset. This is due to three main issues:
Private data: You cannot train your model on data you don’t own
or have the right to use.
New data: New data is generated every second. Thus, you would
have to constantly train your LLM to keep up.
Costs: Training or fine-tuning an LLM is an extremely costly
operation. Hence, it is not feasible to do it on an hourly or daily
basis.
RAG solves these issues, as you no longer have to constantly fine-
tune your LLM on new data (or even private data). Directly injecting
the necessary data to respond to user questions into the prompts
that are fed to the LLM is enough to generate correct and valuable
answers.
To conclude, RAG is key for a robust and flexible generative AI
system. But how do we inject the right data into the prompt based on
the user’s questions? We will dig into the technical aspects of RAG
in the next sections.
The vanilla RAG framework
Every RAG system is similar at its roots. We will first focus on
understanding RAG in its simplest form. Later, we will gradually

## Page 197

introduce more advanced RAG techniques to improve the system’s
accuracy. Note that we will use vanilla and naive RAG
interchangeably to avoid repetition.
A RAG system is composed of three main modules independent of
each other:
Ingestion pipeline: A batch or streaming pipeline used to
populate the vector DB
Retrieval pipeline: A module that queries the vector DB and
retrieves relevant entries to the user’s input
Generation pipeline: The layer that uses the retrieved data to
augment the prompt and an LLM to generate answers
As these three components are classes or services of their own, we
will dig into each separately. But for now, let’s try to answer the
question “How are these three modules connected?”. Here is a very
simplistic overview:
1. On the backend side, the ingestion pipeline runs either on a
schedule or constantly to populate the vector DB with external
data.
2. On the client side, the user asks a question.
3. The question is passed to the retrieval module, which
preprocesses the user’s input and queries the vector DB.

## Page 198

4. The generation pipelines use a prompt template, user input, and
retrieved context to create the prompt.
5. The prompt is passed to an LLM to generate the answer.
6. The answer is shown to the user.
Figure 4.1: Vanilla RAG architecture

## Page 199

You must implement RAG in your generative AI application when you
need access to any type of external information. For example, when
implementing a financial assistant, you most likely need access to
the latest news, reports, and prices before providing valuable
answers. Or, if you build a traveling recommender, you must retrieve
and parse a list of potential attractions, restaurants, and activities. At
training time, LLMs don’t have access to your specific data, so you
will often have to implement a RAG strategy in your generative AI
project. Now, let’s dig into the ingestion, retrieval, and generation
pipelines.
Ingestion pipeline
The RAG ingestion pipeline extracts raw documents from various
data sources (e.g., data warehouse, data lake, web pages, etc.).
Then, it cleans, chunks (splits into smaller sections), and embeds the
documents. Ultimately, it loads the embedded chunks into a vector
DB (or other similar vector storage).
Thus, the RAG ingestion pipeline is split into the following:
The data extraction module gathers all the necessary data from
various sources such as DBs, APIs, or web pages. This module is
highly dependent on your data. It can be as easy as querying your
data warehouse or something more complex such as crawling
Wikipedia.

## Page 200

A cleaning layer standardizes and removes unwanted characters
from the extracted data. For example, you must remove all invalid
characters from your input text, such as non-ASCII and bold and
italic characters. Another popular cleaning strategy is to replace
URLs with placeholders. However, your cleaning strategy will vary
depending on your data source and embedding model.
The chunking module splits the cleaned documents into smaller
ones. As we want to pass the document’s content to an
embedding model, this is necessary to ensure it doesn’t exceed
the model’s input maximum size. Also, chunking is required to
separate specific regions that are semantically related. For
example, when chunking a book’s chapter, the most optimal way
is to group similar paragraphs into the same section or chunk. By
doing so, at the retrieval time, you will add only the essential data
to the prompt.
The embedding component uses an embedding model to take
the chunk’s content (text, images, audio, etc.) and project it into a
dense vector packed with semantic value—more on embeddings
in the What are embeddings? section below.
The loading module takes the embedded chunks along with a
metadata document. The metadata will contain essential
information such as the embedded content, the URL to the source
of the chunk, and when the content was published on the web.
The embedding is used as an index to query similar chunks, while

## Page 201

the metadata is used to access the information added to augment
the prompt.
At this point, we have a RAG ingestion pipeline that takes raw
documents as input, processes them, and populates a vector DB.
The next step is to retrieve relevant data from the vector store
correctly.
Retrieval pipeline
The retrieval components take the user’s input (text, image, audio,
etc.), embed it, and query the vector DB for similar vectors to the
user’s input.
The primary function of the retrieval step is to project the user’s input
into the same vector space as the embeddings used as an index in
the vector DB. This allows us to find the top K’s most similar entries
by comparing the embeddings from the vector storage with the
user’s input vector. These entries then serve as content to augment
the prompt that is passed to the LLM to generate the answer.
You must use a distance metric to compare two vectors, such as the
Euclidean or Manhattan distance. But the most popular one is the
cosine distance, which is equal to 1 minus the cosine of the angle
between two vectors, as follows:

## Page 202

It ranges from -1 to 1 , with a value of -1 when vectors A and B
are in opposite directions, 0 if they are orthogonal, and 1 if they
point in the same direction.
Most of the time, the cosine distance works well in non-linear
complex vector spaces. However, it is essential to notice that
choosing the proper distance between two vectors depends on your
data and the embedding model you use.
One critical factor to highlight is that the user’s input and
embeddings must be in the same vector space. Otherwise, you
cannot compute the distance between them. To do so, it is essential
to preprocess the user input in the same way you processed the raw
documents in the RAG ingestion pipeline. This means you must
clean, chunk (if necessary), and embed the user’s input using the
same functions, models, and hyperparameters. This is similar to how
you have to preprocess the data into features in the same way
between training and inference; otherwise, the inference will yield
inaccurate results—a phenomenon also known as the training-
serving skew.
Generation pipeline

## Page 203

The last step of the RAG system is to take the user’s input, retrieve
data, pass it to an LLM, and generate a valuable answer.
The final prompt results from a system and prompt template
populated with the user’s query and retrieved context. You might
have a single prompt template or multiple prompt templates,
depending on your application. Usually, all the prompt engineering is
done at the prompt template level.
Below, you can see a dummy example of what a generic system and
prompt template look like and how they are used together with the
retrieval logic and the LLM to generate the final answer:
system_template = """
You are a helpful assistant who answers all the us
"""
prompt_template = """
Answer the user's question using only the provided
Context: {context}
User question: {user_question}
"""
user_question = "<your_question>"
retrieved_context = retrieve(user_question)
prompt = f"{system_template}\n"
prompt += prompt_template.format(context=retrieved
answer = llm(prompt)

## Page 204

As the prompt templates evolve, each change should be tracked and
versioned using machine learning operations (MLOps) best
practices. Thus, during training or inference time, you always know
that a given answer was generated by a specific version of the LLM
and prompt template(s). You can do this through Git, store the
prompt templates in a DB, or use specific prompt management tools
such as LangFuse.
As we’ve seen in the retrieval pipeline, some critical aspects that
directly impact the accuracy of your RAG system are the
embeddings of the external data, usually stored in vector DBs, the
embedding of the user’s query, and how we can find similarities
between the two using functions such as the cosine distance. To
better understand this part of the RAG algorithm, let’s zoom in on
what embeddings are and how they are computed.
What are embeddings?
Imagine you’re trying to teach a computer to understand the world.
Embeddings are like a particular translator that turns these things
into a numerical code. This code isn’t random, though, because
similar words or items end up with codes that are close to each
other. It’s like a map where words with similar meanings are
clustered together.

## Page 205

With that in mind, a more theoretical definition is that embeddings
are dense numerical representations of objects encoded as vectors
in a continuous vector space, such as words, images, or items in a
recommendation system. This transformation helps capture the
semantic meaning and relationships between the objects. For
instance, in natural language processing (NLP), embeddings
translate words into vectors where semantically similar words are
positioned closely together in the vector space.

## Page 206

Figure 4.2: What are embeddings?
A popular method is visualizing the embeddings to understand and
evaluate their geometrical relationship. As the embeddings often
have more than 2 or 3 dimensions, usually between 64 and 2048,
you must project them again to 2D or 3D.
For example, you can use UMAP (https://umap-
learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a
dimensionality reduction method well known for keeping the
geometrical properties between the points when projecting the
embeddings to 2D or 3D. Another popular algorithm for
dimensionality reduction when visualizing vectors is t-SNE
(https://scikit-
learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSN
E.html). However, compared to UMAP, it is more stochastic and
doesn’t preserve the topological relationships between the points.
A dimensionality reduction algorithm, such as PCA,
UMAP, and t-SNE, is a mathematical technique used to
reduce the number of input variables or features in a
dataset while preserving the data’s essential patterns,
structure, and relationships. The goal is to transform
high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form,
making it easier to visualize, interpret, and process

## Page 207

while minimizing the loss of important information.
These methods help to address the “curse of
dimensionality,” improve computational efficiency, and
often enhance the performance of ML algorithms.

documentation)

## Page 208

Why embeddings are so powerful
Firstly, ML models work only with numerical values. This is not a
problem when working with tabular data, as the data is often in
numerical form or can easily be processed into numbers.
Embeddings come in handy when we want to feed words, images, or
audio data into models.
For instance, when working with transformer models, you tokenize
all your text input, where each token has an embedding associated
with it. The beauty of this process lies in its simplicity; the input to the
transformer is a sequence of embeddings, which can be easily and
confidently interpreted by the dense layers of the neural network.
Based on this example, you can use embeddings to encode any
categorical variable and feed it to an ML model. But why not use
other simple methods, such as one-hot encoding? When working
with categorical variables with high cardinality, such as language
vocabularies, you will suffer from the curse of dimensionality when
using other classical methods. For example, if your vocabulary has
10,000 tokens, then only one token will have a length of 10,000 after
applying one-hot encoding. If the input sequence has N tokens, that
will become N * 10,000 input parameters. If N >= 100, often, when
inputting text, the input is too large to be usable. Another issue with
other classical methods that don’t suffer from the curse of

## Page 209

dimensionality, such as hashing, is that you lose the semantic
relationships between the vectors.
One-hot encoding is a technique that converts
categorical variables into a binary matrix
representation. Each category is represented as a
unique binary vector. For each categorical variable, a
binary vector is created with a length equal to the
number of unique categories, where all values are zero
except for the index corresponding to the specific
category, which is set to one. The method preserves all
information about the categories. It is simple and
interpretable. However, a significant disadvantage is
that it can lead to a high-dimensional feature space if
the categorical variable has many unique values,
making the method impractical.
Feature hashing, also known as hashing encoding or
the “hash trick,” is a technique used to convert
categorical variables into numerical features by
applying a hash function to the category values.
Compared to one-hot encoding, the method is not
bound to the number of unique categories, but it
reduces the dimensionality of the feature space by
mapping categories into a fixed number of bins or

## Page 210

buckets. Thus, it reduces the dimensionality of the
feature space, which is particularly useful when dealing
with high-cardinality categorical variables. This makes
it efficient in terms of memory usage and computational
time. However, there is a risk of collisions, where
different categories might map to the same bin, leading
to a loss of information. The mapping makes the
method uninterpretable. Also, it is difficult to
understand the relationship between the original
categories and the hashed features.
Embeddings help us encode categorical variables
while controlling the output vector’s dimension. They
also use ingenious ways to condense information into a
lower dimension space than naive hashing tricks.
Secondly, embedding your input reduces the size of its dimension
and condenses all of its semantic meaning into a dense vector. This
is an extremely popular technique when working with images, where
a CNN encoder module maps the high-dimensional meaning into an
embedding, which is later processed by a CNN decoder that
performs the classification or regression steps.
The following image shows a typical CNN layout. Imagine tiny
squares within each layer. Those are the “receptive fields.” Each

## Page 211

square feeds information to a single neuron in the previous layer. As
you move through the network, two key things are happening:
Shrinking the picture: Special “subsampling” operations make
the layers smaller, focusing on essential details.
Learning features: “Convolution” operations, on the other hand,
actually increase the layer size as the network learns more
complex features from the image.
Finally, a fully connected layer at the end takes all this processed
information and transforms it into the final vector embedding, a
numerical image representation.

How are embeddings created?
Embeddings are created by deep learning models that understand
the context and semantics of your input and project it into a
continuous vector space.
Various deep learning models can be used to create embeddings,
varying by the data input type. Thus, it is fundamental to understand
your data and what you need from it before picking an embedding
model.
For example, when working with text data, one of the early methods
used to create embeddings for your vocabulary is Word2Vec and
GloVe. These are still popular methods used today for simpler
applications.
Another popular method is to use encoder-only transformers, such
as BERT, or other methods from its family, such as RoBERTa. These

## Page 213

models leverage the encoder of the transformer architecture to
smartly project your input into a dense vector space that can later be
used as embeddings.
To quickly compute the embeddings in Python, you can conveniently
leverage the Sentence Transformers Python package (also available
in Hugging Face’s transformer package). This tool provides a user-
friendly interface, making the embedding process straightforward
and efficient.
In the code snippet below, you can see how we loaded a model from
SentenceTransformer, computed the embeddings for three
sentences, and, ultimately, computed the cosine similarity between
them. The similarity between one sentence and itself is always 1.
Also, the similarity between the first and second sentences is
approximately 0, as the sentences have nothing in common. In
contrast, the value between the first and third one is higher as there
is some overlapping context:
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransfor
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
sentences = [
"The dog sits outside waiting for a treat.",
"I am going swimming.",
"The dog is swimming."
]

embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# Output: [3, 384]
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embedd

py.
The examples in the embeddings section can be run
within the virtual environment used across the book, as
it contains all the required dependencies.
The best-performing embedding model can change with time and
your specific use case. You can find particular models on the

## Page 215

Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) on Hugging Face.
Depending on your needs, you can consider the best-performing
model, the one with the best accuracy, or the one with the smallest
memory footprint. This decision is solely based on your requirements
(e.g., accuracy and hardware). However, Hugging Face and
SentenceTransformer make switching between different models
straightforward. Thus, you can always experiment with various
options.
When working with images, you can embed them using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Popular CNN networks
are based on the ResNet architecture. However, we can’t directly
use image embedding techniques for audio recordings. Instead, we
can create a visual representation of the audio, such as a
spectrogram, and then apply image embedding models to those
visuals. This allows us to capture the essence of images and sounds
in a way computers can understand.
By leveraging models like CLIP, you can practically embed a piece of
text and an image in the same vector space. This allows you to find
similar images using a sentence as input, or the other way around,
demonstrating the practicality of CLIP.
In the following code snippet, we use CLIP to encode a crazy cat
image and three sentences. Ultimately, we use cosine similarity to

## Page 216

compute the resemblance between the picture and the sentences:
from io import BytesIO
import requests
from PIL import Image
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransfor
response = requests.get(
"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineerin
)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
model = SentenceTransformer("clip-ViT-B-32")
img_emb = model.encode(image)
text_emb = model.encode(
["A crazy cat smiling.",
"A white and brown cat with a yellow bandana.",
"A man eating in the garden."]
)
print(text_emb.shape) # noqa
# Output: (3, 512)
similarity_scores = model.similarity(img_emb, text
print(similarity_scores) # noqa
# Output: tensor([[0.3068, 0.3300, 0.1719]])

dings.py.
Here, we provided a small introduction to how embeddings can be
computed. The realm of specific implementations is vast, but what is
important to know is that embeddings can be computed for most
digital data categories, such as words, sentences, documents,
images, videos, and graphs.
It’s crucial to grasp that you must use specialized models when you
need to compute the distance between two different data categories,
such as the distance between the vector of a sentence and of an
image. These models are designed to project both data types into
the same vector space, such as CLIP, ensuring accurate distance
computation.
Applications of embeddings
Due to the generative AI revolution, which uses RAG, embeddings
have become extremely popular in information retrieval tasks, such
as semantic search for text, code, images, and audio, and long-term
memory of agents. But before generative AI, embeddings were
already heavily used in:
Representing categorical variables (e.g., vocabulary tokens) that
are fed to an ML model

## Page 218

Recommender systems by encoding the users and items and
finding their relationship
Clustering and outlier detection
Data visualization by using algorithms such as UMAP
Classification by using the embeddings as features
Zero-shot classification by comparing the embedding of each
class and picking the most similar one
The last step to fully understanding how RAG works is to examine
vector DBs and how they leverage embeddings to retrieve data.
More on vector DBs
Vector DBs are specialized DBs designed to efficiently store, index,
and retrieve vector embeddings. Traditional scalar-based DBs
struggle with the complexity of vector data, making vector DBs
crucial for tasks like real-time semantic search.
While standalone vector indices like FAISS are effective for similarity
search, they lack vector DBs’ comprehensive data management
capabilities. Vector DBs support CRUD operations, metadata
filtering, scalability, real-time updates, backups, ecosystem
integration, and robust data security, making them more suited for
production environments than standalone indices.

## Page 219

How does a vector DB work?
Think of how you usually search a DB. You type in something
specific, and the system spits out the exact match. That’s how
traditional DBs work. Vector DBs are different. Instead of perfect
matches, we look for the closest neighbors of the query vector.
Under the hood, a vector DB uses approximate nearest neighbor
(ANN) algorithms to find these close neighbors.
While ANN algorithms don’t return the top matches for a given
search, standard nearest neighbor algorithms are too slow to work in
practice. Also, it is shown empirically that using only approximations
of the top matches for a given input query works well enough. Thus,
the trade-off between accuracy and latency ultimately favors ANN
algorithms.
This is a typical workflow of a vector DB:
1. Indexing vectors: Vectors are indexed using data structures
optimized for high-dimensional data. Common indexing
techniques include hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW),
random projection, product quantization (PQ), and locality-
sensitive hashing (LSH).
2. Querying for similarity: During a search, the DB queries the
indexed vectors to find those most similar to the input vector. This
process involves comparing vectors based on similarity measures

## Page 220

such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product. Each
has unique advantages and is suitable for different use cases.
3. Post-processing results: After identifying potential matches, the
results undergo post-processing to refine accuracy. This step
ensures that the most relevant vectors are returned to the user.
Vector DBs can filter results based on metadata before or after the
vector search. Both approaches have trade-offs in terms of
performance and accuracy. The query also depends on the
metadata (along with the vector index), so it contains a metadata
index user for filtering operations.
Algorithms for creating the vector
index
Vector DBs use various algorithms to create the vector index and
manage searching data efficiently:
Random projection: Random projection reduces the
dimensionality of vectors by projecting them into a lower-
dimensional space using a random matrix. This technique
preserves the relative distances between vectors, facilitating
faster searches.
PQ: PQ compresses vectors by dividing them into smaller sub-
vectors and then quantizing these sub-vectors into representative

## Page 221

codes. This reduces memory usage and speeds up similarity
searches.
LSH: LSH maps similar vectors into buckets. This method enables
fast approximate nearest neighbor searches by focusing on a
subset of the data, reducing the computational complexity.
HNSW: HNSW constructs a multi-layer graph where each node
represents a set of vectors. Similar nodes are connected, allowing
the algorithm to navigate the graph and find the nearest neighbors
efficiently.
These algorithms enable vector DBs to efficiently handle complex
and large-scale data, making them a perfect fit for a variety of AI and
ML applications.
DB operations
Vector DBs also share common characteristics with standard DBs to
ensure high performance, fault tolerance, and ease of management
in production environments. Key operations include:
Sharding and replication: Data is partitioned (sharded) across
multiple nodes to ensure scalability and high availability. Data
replication across nodes helps maintain data integrity and
availability in case of node failures.
Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of DB performance, including
query latency and resource usage (RAM, CPU, disk), helps

## Page 222

maintain optimal operations and identify potential issues before
they impact the system.
Access control: Implementing robust access control
mechanisms ensures that only authorized users can access and
modify data. This includes role-based access controls and other
security protocols to protect sensitive information.
Backups: Regular DB backups are critical for disaster recovery.
Automated backup processes ensure that data can be restored to
a previous state in case of corruption or loss.
An overview of advanced RAG
The vanilla RAG framework we just presented doesn’t address many
fundamental aspects that impact the quality of the retrieval and
answer generation, such as:
Are the retrieved documents relevant to the user’s question?
Is the retrieved context enough to answer the user’s question?
Is there any redundant information that only adds noise to the
augmented prompt?
Does the latency of the retrieval step match our requirements?
What do we do if we can’t generate a valid answer using the
retrieved information?
From the questions above, we can draw two conclusions. The first
one is that we need a robust evaluation module for our RAG system

## Page 223

that can quantify and measure the quality of the retrieved data and
generate answers relative to the user’s question. We will discuss this
topic in more detail in Chapter 9. The second conclusion is that we
must improve our RAG framework to address the retrieval limitations
directly in the algorithm. These improvements are known as
advanced RAG.
The vanilla RAG design can be optimized at three different stages:
Pre-retrieval: This stage focuses on how to structure and
preprocess your data for data indexing optimizations as well as
query optimizations.
Retrieval: This stage revolves around improving the embedding
models and metadata filtering to improve the vector search step.
Post-retrieval: This stage mainly targets different ways to filter
out noise from the retrieved documents and compress the prompt
before feeding it to an LLM for answer generation.

## Page 224

Figure 4.5: The three stages of advanced RAG
This section is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the advanced
RAG methods available. The goal is to build an intuition about what
can be optimized. We will use only examples based on text data, but

## Page 225

the principles of advanced RAG remain the same regardless of the
data category. Now, let’s zoom in on all three components.
Pre-retrieval
The pre-retrieval steps are performed in two different ways:
Data indexing: It is part of the RAG ingestion pipeline. It is mainly
implemented within the cleaning or chunking modules to
preprocess the data for better indexing.
Query optimization: The algorithm is performed directly on the
user’s query before embedding it and retrieving the chunks from
the vector DB.
As we index our data using embeddings that semantically represent
the content of a chunked document, most of the data indexing
techniques focus on better preprocessing and structuring the data to
improve retrieval efficiency, such as:
Sliding window: The sliding window technique introduces overlap
between text chunks, ensuring that important context near chunk
boundaries is retained, which enhances retrieval accuracy. This is
particularly beneficial in domains like legal documents, scientific
papers, customer support logs, and medical records, where
critical information often spans multiple sections. The embedding
is computed on the chunk along with the overlapping portion.

## Page 226

Hence, the sliding window improves the system’s ability to retrieve
relevant and coherent information by maintaining context across
boundaries.
Enhancing data granularity: This involves data cleaning
techniques like removing irrelevant details, verifying factual
accuracy, and updating outdated information. A clean and
accurate dataset allows for sharper retrieval.
Metadata: Adding metadata tags like dates, URLs, external IDs,
or chapter markers helps filter results efficiently during retrieval.
Optimizing index structures: It is based on different data index
methods, such as various chunk sizes and multi-indexing
strategies.
Small-to-big: The algorithm decouples the chunks used for
retrieval and the context used in the prompt for the final answer
generation. The algorithm uses a small sequence of text to
compute the embedding while preserving the sequence itself and
a wider window around it in the metadata. Thus, using smaller
chunks enhances the retrieval’s accuracy, while the larger context
adds more contextual information to the LLM.
The intuition behind this is that if we use the whole text for computing
the embedding, we might introduce too much noise, or the text could
contain multiple topics, which results in a poor overall semantic
representation of the embedding.

## Page 227

Figure 4.6: Query routing
On the query optimization side, we can leverage techniques such
as query routing, query rewriting, and query expansion to refine the

## Page 228

retrieved information for the LLM further:
Query routing: Based on the user’s input, we might have to
interact with different categories of data and query each category
differently. Query rooting is used to decide what action to take
based on the user’s input, similar to if/else statements. Still, the
decisions are made solely using natural language instead of
logical statements.
As illustrated in Figure 4.6, let’s assume that, based on the user’s
input, to do RAG, we can retrieve additional context from a vector
DB using vector search queries, a standard SQL DB by translating
the user query to an SQL command, or the internet by leveraging
REST API calls. The query router can also detect whether a context
is required, helping us avoid making redundant calls to external data
storage. Also, a query router can be used to pick the best prompt
template for a given input. For example, in the LLM Twin use case,
depending on whether the user wants an article paragraph, a post,
or a code snippet, you need different prompt templates to optimize
the creation process. The routing usually uses an LLM to decide
what route to take or embeddings by picking the path with the most
similar vectors. To summarize, query routing is identical to an if/else
statement but much more versatile as it works directly with natural
language.

## Page 229

Query rewriting: Sometimes, the user’s initial query might not
perfectly align with the way your data is structured. Query
rewriting tackles this by reformulating the question to match the
indexed information better. This can involve techniques like:
Paraphrasing: Rephrasing the user’s query while preserving
its meaning (e.g., “What are the causes of climate change?”
could be rewritten as “Factors contributing to global warming”).
Synonym substitution: Replacing less common words with
synonyms to broaden the search scope (e.g., “ joyful” could be
rewritten as “happy”).
Sub-queries: For longer queries, we can break them down into
multiple shorter and more focused sub-queries. This can help
the retrieval stage identify relevant documents more precisely.
Hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE): This technique
involves having an LLM create a hypothetical response to the
query. Then, both the original query and the LLM’s response are
fed into the retrieval stage.
Query expansion: This approach aims to enrich the user’s
question by adding additional terms or concepts, resulting in
different perspectives of the same initial question. For example,
when searching for “disease,” you can leverage synonyms and
related terms associated with the original query words and also
include “illnesses” or “ailments.”

## Page 230

Self-query: The core idea is to map unstructured queries into
structured ones. An LLM identifies key entities, events, and
relationships within the input text. These identities are used as
filtering parameters to reduce the vector search space (e.g.,
identify cities within the query, for example, “Paris,” and add it to
your filter to reduce your vector search space).
Both data indexing and query optimization pre-retrieval optimization
techniques depend highly on your data type, structure, and source.
Thus, as with any data processing pipeline, no method always
works, as every use case has its own particularities and gotchas.
Optimizing your pre-retrieval RAG layer is experimental. Thus, what
is essential is to try multiple methods (such as the ones enumerated
in this section), reiterate, and observe what works best.
Retrieval
The retrieval step can be optimized in two fundamental ways:
Improving the embedding models used in the RAG ingestion
pipeline to encode the chunked documents and, at inference time,
transform the user’s input.
Leveraging the DB’s filter and search features. This step will
be used solely at inference time when you have to retrieve the
most similar chunks based on user input.

## Page 231

Both strategies are aligned with our ultimate goal: to enhance the
vector search step by leveraging the semantic similarity between the
query and the indexed data.
When improving the embedding models, you usually have to fine-
tune the pre-trained embedding models to tailor them to specific
jargon and nuances of your domain, especially for areas with
evolving terminology or rare terms.
Instead of fine-tuning the embedding model, you can leverage
instructor models
(https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-xl) to guide the
embedding generation process with an instruction/prompt aimed at
your domain. Tailoring your embedding network to your data using
such a model can be a good option, as fine-tuning a model
consumes more computing and human resources.
In the code snippet below, you can see an example of an Instructor
model that embeds article titles about AI:
from InstructorEmbedding import INSTRUCTOR
model = INSTRUCTOR("hkunlp/instructor-base")
sentence = "RAG Fundamentals First"
instruction = "Represent the title of an article a
embeddings = model.encode([[instruction, sentence]

# Output: (1, 768)
The source code can be found at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering/blob/main/code_snippets/08_instructor_embed
dings.py.
To run the instructor code, you have to create a
different virtual environment and activate it:
python3 -m venv instructor_venv && source instruct
And install the required Python dependencies:
pip install sentence-transformers==2.2.2 Instructo
On the other side of the spectrum, here is how you can improve your
retrieval by leveraging classic filter and search DB features:
Hybrid search: This is a vector and keyword-based search blend.
Keyword-based search excels at identifying documents containing

## Page 233

specific keywords. When your task demands pinpoint accuracy
and the retrieved information must include exact keyword
matches, hybrid search shines. Vector search, while powerful, can
sometimes struggle with finding exact matches, but it excels at
finding more general semantic similarities. You leverage both
keyword matching and semantic similarities by combining the two
methods. You have a parameter, usually called alpha, that
controls the weight between the two methods. The algorithm has
two independent searches, which are later normalized and
unified.
Filtered vector search: This type of search leverages the
metadata index to filter for specific keywords within the metadata.
It differs from a hybrid search in that you retrieve the data once
using only the vector index and perform the filtering step before or
after the vector search to reduce your search space.
In practice, on the retrieval side, you usually start with filtered vector
search or hybrid search, as they are fairly quick to implement. This
approach gives you the flexibility to adjust your strategy based on
performance. If the results are not as expected, you can always fine-
tune your embedding model.
Post-retrieval

## Page 234

The post-retrieval optimizations are solely performed on the retrieved
data to ensure that the LLM’s performance is not compromised by
issues such as limited context windows or noisy data. This is
because the retrieved context can sometimes be too large or contain
irrelevant information, both of which can distract the LLM.
Two popular methods performed at the post-retrieval step are:
Prompt compression: Eliminate unnecessary details while
keeping the essence of the data.
Re-ranking: Use a cross-encoder ML model to give a matching
score between the user’s input and every retrieved chunk. The
retrieved items are sorted based on this score. Only the top N
results are kept as the most relevant. As you can see in Figure
4.7, this works because the re-ranking model can find more
complex relationships between the user input and some content
than a simple similarity search. However, we can’t apply this
model at the initial retrieval step because it is costly. That is why a
popular strategy is to retrieve the data using a similarity distance
between the embeddings and refine the retrieved information
using a re-raking model, as illustrated in Figure 4.8.

## Page 235

Figure 4.7: Bi-encoder (the standard embedding model) versus
cross-encoder
The abovementioned techniques are far from an exhaustive list of all
potential solutions. We used them as examples to get an intuition on
what you can (and should) optimize at each step in your RAG

## Page 236

workflow. The truth is that these techniques can vary tremendously
by the type of data you work with.
For example, if you work with multi-modal data such as text and
images, most of the techniques from earlier won’t work as they are
designed for text only.

## Page 237

Figure 4.8: The re-ranking algorithm
To summarize, the primary goal of these optimizations is to enhance
the RAG algorithm at three key stages: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and
post-retrieval. This involves preprocessing data for improved vector
indexing, adjusting user queries for more accurate searches,
enhancing the embedding model, utilizing classic filtering DB
operations, and removing noisy data. By keeping these goals in
mind, you can effectively optimize your RAG workflow for data
processing and retrieval
Exploring the LLM Twin’s RAG
feature pipeline architecture
Now that you have a strong intuition and understanding of RAG and
its workings, we will continue exploring our particular LLM Twin use
case. The goal is to provide a hands-on end-to-end example to
solidify the theory presented in this chapter.
Any RAG system is split into two independent components:
The ingestion pipeline takes in raw data, cleans, chunks,
embeds, and loads it into a vector DB.
The inference pipeline queries the vector DB for relevant context
and ultimately generates an answer by levering an LLM.

## Page 238

In this chapter, we will focus on implementing the RAG ingestion
pipeline, and in Chapter 9, we will continue developing the inference
pipeline.
With that in mind, let’s have a quick refresher on the problem we are
trying to solve and where we get our raw data. Remember that we
are building an end-to-end ML system. Thus, all the components talk
to each other through an interface (or a contract), and each pipeline
has a single responsibility. In our case, we ingest raw documents,
preprocess them, and load them into a vector DB.
The problem we are solving
As presented in the previous chapter, this book aims to show you
how to build a production-ready LLM Twin backed by an end-to-end
ML system. In this chapter specifically, we want to design a RAG
feature pipeline that takes raw social media data (e.g., articles, code
repositories, and posts) from our MongoDB data warehouse. The
text of the raw documents will be cleaned, chunked, embedded, and
ultimately loaded to a feature store. As discussed in Chapter 1, we
will implement a logical feature store using ZenML artifacts and a
Qdrant vector DB.
As we want to build a fully automated feature pipeline, we want to
sync the data warehouse and logical feature store. Remember that,

## Page 239

at inference time, the context used to generate the answer is
retrieved from the vector DB. Thus, the speed of synchronization
between the data warehouse and the feature store will directly
impact the accuracy of our RAG algorithm.
Another key consideration is how to automate the feature pipeline
and integrate it with the rest of our ML system. Our goal is to
minimize any desynchronization between the two data storages, as
this could potentially compromise the integrity of our system.
To conclude, we must design a feature pipeline that constantly syncs
the data warehouse and logical feature store while processing the
data accordingly. Having the data in a feature store is critical for a
production-ready ML system. The LLM Twin inference pipeline will
query it for RAG, while the training pipeline will consume tracked and
versioned fine-tuning datasets from it.
The feature store
The feature store will be the central access point for all the
features used within the training and inference pipelines. The training
pipeline will use the cleaned data from the feature store (stored as
artifacts) to fine-tune LLMs. The inference pipeline will query the
vector DB for chunked documents for RAG. That is why we are
designing a feature pipeline and not only a RAG ingestion pipeline.

## Page 240

In practice, the feature pipeline contains multiple subcomponents,
one of which is the RAG logic.
Remember that the feature pipeline is mainly used as a mind map to
navigate the complexity of ML systems. It clearly states that it takes
raw data as input and then outputs features and optional labels,
which are stored in the feature store. Thus, a good intuition is to
consider that all the logic between the data warehouse and the
feature store goes into the feature pipeline namespace, consisting of
one or more sub-pipelines. For example, we will implement another
pipeline that takes in cleaned data, processes it into instruct
datasets, and stores it in artifacts; this also sits under the feature
pipeline umbrella as the artifacts are part of the logical feature store.
Another example would be implementing a data validation pipeline
on top of the raw data or computed features.
Another important observation to make is that text data stored as
strings are not considered features if you follow the standard
conventions. A feature is something that is fed directly into the
model. For example, we would have to tokenize the instruct datasets
or chunked documents to be considered features. Why? Because
the tokens are fed directly to the model and not the sentences as
strings. Unfortunately, this makes the system more complex and
unflexible. Thus, we will do the tokenization at runtime. But this
observation is important to understand as it’s a clear example that

## Page 241

you don’t have to be too rigid about the feature/training/inference
(FTI) architecture. You have to take it and adapt it to your own use
case.
Where does the raw data come from?
As a quick reminder, all the raw documents are stored in a MongoDB
data warehouse. The data warehouse is populated by the data
collection ETL pipeline presented in Chapter 3. The ETL pipeline
crawls various platforms such as Medium and Substack,
standardizes the data, and loads it into MongoDB. Check out
Chapter 3 for more details on this topic.
Designing the architecture of the RAG feature
pipeline
The last step is to architect and go through the design of the RAG
feature pipeline of the LLM Twin application. We will use a batch
design scheduled to poll data from the MongoDB data warehouse,
process it, and load it to a Qdrant vector DB. The first question to
ask ourselves is, “Why a batch pipeline?”
But before answering that, let’s quickly understand how a batch
architecture works and behaves relative to a streaming design.

## Page 242

Figure 4.9: The architecture of the LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline
Batch pipelines
A batch pipeline in data systems refers to a data processing method
where data is collected, processed, and stored in predefined
intervals and larger volumes, also known as “batches”. This

## Page 243

approach differs from real-time or streaming data processing, where
data is processed continuously as it arrives. This is what happens in
a batch pipeline:
1. Data collection: Data is collected from various sources and
stored until sufficient amounts are accumulated for processing.
This can include data from DBs, logs, files, and other sources.
2. Scheduled processing: Data processing is scheduled at regular
intervals, for example, hourly or daily. During this time, the
collected data is processed in bulk. This can involve data
cleansing, transformation, aggregation, and other operations.
3. Data loading: After processing, the data is loaded into the target
system, such as a DB, data warehouse, data lake, or feature
store. This processed data is then available for analysis, querying,
or further processing.
Batch pipelines are particularly useful when dealing with large
volumes of data that do not require immediate processing. They offer
several advantages, including:
Efficiency: Batch processing can handle large volumes of data
more efficiently than real-time processing, allowing for optimized
resource allocation and parallel processing.
Complex processing: Batch pipelines can perform complex data
transformations and aggregations that might be too resource-

## Page 244

intensive for real-time processing.
Simplicity: Batch processing systems’ architectures are often
simpler than those of real-time systems, making them easier to
implement and maintain.
Batch versus streaming pipelines
When implementing feature pipelines, you have two main design
choices: batch and streaming. Thus, it is worthwhile to see the
difference between the two and understand why we chose a batch
architecture over a streaming one for our LLM Twin use case.
You can effortlessly write a dedicated chapter on streaming
pipelines, which suggests its complexity over a batch design.
However, as streaming architectures become increasingly popular,
one must have an intuition of how they work to choose the best
option for your application.
The core elements of streaming applications are a distributed event
streaming platform such as Apache Kafka or Redpanda to store
events from multiple clients and a streaming engine such as Apache
Flink or Bytewax to process the events. To simplify your architecture,
you can swap your event streaming platform with queues, such as
RabbitMQ, to store the events until processed. Table 4.1 compares
batch and streaming pipelines based on multiple criteria such as
processing schedule and complexity:

Table 4.1: Batch versus streaming pipelines

## Page 247

For example, streaming pipelines are extremely powerful in social
media recommender systems like TikTok. When using social media,
user behavior changes frequently. A typical scenario is that you want
to relax at a certain point in time and mostly look at videos of
puppies. Still, after 15 minutes, you get bored and want something
more serious, such as educative content or news. This means the
recommender system has to capture these behavior changes
without delay to keep you engaged. As the transition between
interests is cyclical and not predictable, you can’t use a batch
pipeline that runs every 30 minutes or every hour to generate more
content. You can run it every minute to create new content, but, at
the same time, it will result in unnecessary costs, as most predictions
will not be consumed. By implementing a streaming pipeline, you
update the features of specific users in real time, which are then
passed to a chain of models that predict the new recommendations.
Streaming architectures are also the backbone of real-time fraud
detection algorithms, such as those used at Stripe or PayPal. In this
context, it’s critical to identify potentially fraudulent transactions as
they occur, not after a few minutes or hours as a batch pipeline
would process them. The same urgency applies to high-frequency
trading platforms that make stock predictions based on the constant
influx of market data, enabling traders to make decisions within
milliseconds.

## Page 248

On the other hand, you can use a batch architecture for an offline
recommender system. For example, when implementing one for an
e-commerce or streaming platform, you don’t need the system to be
so reactive, as the user’s behavior rarely changes. Thus, updating
the recommendations periodically, such as every night, based on
historical user behavior data using a batch pipeline is easier to
implement and cheaper.
Another popular example of batch pipelines is the ETL design used
to extract, transform, and load data for different use cases. The ETL
design is widespread in data pipelines used to move data from one
DB to another. Some practical use cases include aggregating data
for analytics, where you have to extract data from multiple sources,
aggregate it, and load it to a data warehouse connected to a
dashboard. The analytics domains can be widespread, from e-
commerce and marketing to finance and research.
The data collection pipeline used in the LLM Twin use case is
another example of an ETL pipeline that extracts data from the
internet, structures it, and loads it into a data warehouse for future
processing.
Along with prediction or feature freshness, another disadvantage of
batch pipelines over streaming ones is that you usually make
redundant predictions. Let’s take the example of a recommender

## Page 249

system for a streaming platform like Netflix. Every night, you make
the predictions for all users. There is a significant chance that a large
chunk of users won’t log in that day. Also, users usually don’t browse
all the recommendations but stick to the first ones. Thus, only a
portion of predictions are used, wasting computing power on all the
others.
That’s why a popular strategy is to start with a batch architecture, as
it’s faster and easier to implement. After the product is in place, you
gradually move to a streaming design to reduce costs and improve
the user experience.
To conclude, we have used a batch architecture (and not a
streaming one) to implement the LLM Twin’s feature pipeline for the
following reasons:
Does not require immediate data processing: Even if syncing
the data warehouse and feature store is critical for an accurate
RAG system, a delay of a few minutes is acceptable. Thus, we
can schedule the batch pipeline to run every minute, constantly
syncing the two data storages. This technique works because the
data volume is small. The whole data warehouse will have only
thousands of records, not millions or billions. Hence, we can
quickly iterate through them and sync the two DBs.

## Page 250

Simplicity: As stated earlier, implementing a streaming pipeline is
two times more complex. In the real world, you want to keep your
system as simple as possible, making it easier to understand,
debug, and maintain. Also, simplicity usually translates to lower
infrastructure and development costs.
In Figure 8.10, we compare what tools you can use based on your
architecture (streaming versus batch) and the quantity of data you
have to process (small versus big data). In our use case, we are in
the smaller data and batch quadrant, where we picked a combination
of vanilla Python and generative AI tools such as LangChain,
Sentence Transformers, and Unstructured.

## Page 251

Figure 4.10: Tools on the streaming versus batch and smaller versus
bigger data spectrum
In the Change data capture: syncing the data warehouse and feature
store section later in this chapter, we will discuss when switching
from a batch architecture to a streaming one makes sense.

## Page 252

Core steps
Most of the RAG feature pipelines are composed of five core steps.
The one implemented in the LLM Twin architecture makes no
exception. Thus, you can quickly adapt this pattern for other RAG
applications, but here is what the LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline
looks like:
1. Data extraction: Extract the latest articles, code repositories, and
posts from the MongoDB data warehouse. At the extraction step,
you usually aggregate all the data you need for processing.
2. Cleaning: The data from the data warehouse is standardized and
partially clean, but we have to ensure that the text contains only
useful information, is not duplicated, and can be interpreted by the
embedding model. For example, we must clean and normalize all
non-ASCII characters before passing the text to the embedding
model. Also, to keep the information semantically dense, we
decided to replace all the URLs with placeholders and remove all
emojis. The cleaning step is more art than science. Hence, after
you have the first iteration with an evaluation mechanism in place,
you will probably reiterate and improve it.
3. Chunking: You must adopt various chunking strategies based on
each data category and embedding model. For example, when
working with code repositories, you want the chunks broader,
whereas when working with articles, you want them narrower or

## Page 253

scoped at the paragraph level. Depending on your data, you must
decide if you split your document based on the chapter, section,
paragraph, sentence, or just a fixed window size. Also, you have
to ensure that the chunk size doesn’t exceed the maximum input
size of the embedding model. That is why you usually chunk a
document based on your data structure and the maximum input
size of the model.
4. Embedding: You pass each chunk individually to an embedding
model of your choice. Implementation-wise, this step is usually the
simplest, as tools such as SentenceTransformer and Hugging
Face provide high-level interfaces for most embedding models. As
explained in the What are embeddings? section of this chapter, at
this step, the most critical decisions are to decide what model to
use and whether to fine-tune it or not. For example, we used an
"all-mpnet-base-v2" embedding model from
SentenceTransformer, which is relatively tiny and runs on most
machines. However, we provide a configuration file where you can
quickly configure the embedding model with something more
powerful based on the state of the art when reading this book. You
can quickly find other options on the MTEB on Hugging Face
(https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).
5. Data loading: The final step combines the embedding of a
chunked document and its metadata, such as the author and the
document ID, content, URL, platform, and creation date.

## Page 254

Ultimately, we wrap the vector and the metadata into a structure
compatible with Qdrant and push it to the vector DB. As we want
to use Qdrant as the single source of truth for the features, we
also push the cleaned documents (before chunking) to Qdrant.
We can push data without vectors, as the metadata index of
Qdrant behaves like a NoSQL DB. Thus, pushing metadata
without a vector attached to it is like using a standard NoSQL
engine.
Change data capture: syncing the
data warehouse and feature store
As highlighted a few times in this chapter, data is constantly
changing, which can result in DBs, data lakes, data warehouses, and
feature stores getting out of sync. Change data capture (CDC) is a
strategy that allows you to optimally keep two or more data storage
types in sync without computing and I/O overhead. It captures any
CRUD operation done on the source DB and replicates it on a target
DB. Optionally, you can add preprocessing steps in between the
replication.
The syncing issues also apply when building a feature pipeline. One
key design choice concerns how to sync the data warehouse with
the feature store to have data fresh enough for your particular use
case.

## Page 255

In our LLM Twin use case, we chose a naïve approach out of
simplicity. We implemented a batch pipeline that is triggered
periodically or manually. It reads all the raw data from the data
warehouse, processes it in batches, and inserts new records or
updates old ones from the Qdrant vector DB. This works fine when
you are working with a small number of records, at the order of
thousands or tens of thousands. But our naïve approach raises the
following questions:
What happens if the data suddenly grows to millions of records (or
higher)?
What happens if a record is deleted from the data warehouse?
How is this reflected in the feature store?
What if we want to process only the new or updated items from
the data warehouse and not all of them?
Fortunately, the CDC pattern can solve all of these issues. When
implementing CDC, you can take multiple approaches, but all of
them use either a push or pull strategy:
Push: The source DB is the primary driver in the push approach.
It actively identifies and transmits data modifications to target
systems for processing. This method ensures near-instantaneous
updates at the target, but data loss can occur if target systems are

## Page 256

inaccessible. To mitigate this, a messaging system is typically
employed as a buffer.
Pull: The pull method assigns a more passive role to the source
DB, which only records data changes. Target systems periodically
request these changes and handle updates accordingly. While this
approach lightens the load on the source, it introduces a delay in
data propagation. A messaging system is again essential to
prevent data loss during periods of target system unavailability.
In summary, the push method is ideal for applications demanding
immediate data access, whereas the pull method is better suited for
large-scale data transfers where real-time updates aren’t critical.
With that in mind, there are different methods to detect changes in
data. Thus, let’s list the main CDC patterns that are used in the
industry:
Timestamp-based: The approach involves adding a modification
time column to DB tables, usually called LAST_MODIFIED or
LAST_UPDATED . Downstream systems can query this column to
identify records that have been updated since their last check.
While simple to implement, this method is limited to tracking
changes, not deletions, and imposes performance overhead due
to the need to scan entire tables.
Trigger-based: The trigger-based approach utilizes DB triggers to
automatically record data modifications in a separate table upon

## Page 257

INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations, often known as the
event table. This method provides comprehensive change
tracking but can impact the DB performance due to the additional
write operations involved for each event.
Log-based: DBs maintain transaction logs to record all data
modifications, including timestamps. Primarily used for recovery,
these logs can also be leveraged to propagate changes to target
systems in real time. This approach minimizes the performance
impact on the source DB. As a huge advantage, it avoids
additional processing overhead on the source DB, captures all
data changes, and requires no schema modification. But on the
opposite side, it lacks standardized log formats, leading to vendor-
specific implementations.
For more details on CDC, I recommend What is
Change Data Capture? from Confluent’s blog:
https://www.confluent.io/en-gb/learn/change-
data-capture/.
With these CDC techniques in mind, we could quickly implement a
pull timestamp-based strategy in our RAG feature pipeline to sync
the data warehouse and feature store more optimally when the data
grows. Our implementation is still pull-based but doesn’t check any

## Page 258

last updated field in the source DB; it just pulls everything from the
data warehouse.
However, the most popular and optimal technique in the industry is
the log-based one. It doesn’t add any I/O overhead to the source DB,
has low latency, and supports all CRUD operations. The biggest
downside is its development complexity, which requires a queue to
capture all the CRUD events and a streaming pipeline to process
them.
As this is an LLM book and not a data engineering one, we wanted
to keep things simple, but it’s important to know that these
techniques exist, and you can always upgrade your current
implementation when it doesn’t fit your application requirements
anymore.
Why is the data stored in two
snapshots?
We store two snapshots of our data in the logical feature store:
After the data is cleaned: For fine-tuning LLMs
After the documents are chunked and embedded: For RAG
Why did we design it this way? Remember that the features should
be accessed solely from the feature store for training and inference.

## Page 259

Thus, this adds consistency to our design and makes it cleaner.
Also, storing the data cleaned specifically for our fine-tuning and
embedding use case in the MongoDB data warehouse would have
been an antipattern. The data from the warehouse is shared all
across the company. Thus, processing it for a specific use case is
not good practice. Imagine another summarization use case where
we must clean and preprocess the data differently. We must create a
new “Cleaned Data” table prefixed with the use case name. We have
to repeat that for every new use case. Therefore, to avoid having a
spaghetti data warehouse, the data from the data warehouse is
generic and is modeled to specific applications only in downstream
components, which, in our case, is the feature store.
Ultimately, as we mentioned in the Core steps section, you can
leverage the metadata index of a vector DB as a NoSQL DB. Based
on these factors, we decided to keep the cleaned data in Qdrant,
along with the chunked and embedded versions of the documents.
As a quick reminder, when operationalizing our LLM Twin system,
the create instruct dataset pipeline, explained in Chapter 5, will read
the cleaned documents from Qdrant, process them, and save them
under a versioned ZenML artifact. The training pipeline requires a
dataset and not plain documents. This is a reminder that our logical

## Page 260

feature store comprises the Qdrant vector DB for online serving and
ZenML artifacts for offline training.
Orchestration
ZenML will orchestrate the batch RAG feature pipeline. Using
ZenML, we can schedule it to run on a schedule, for example, every
hour, or quickly manually trigger it. Another option is to trigger it after
the ETL data collection pipeline finishes.
By orchestrating the feature pipeline and integrating it into ZenML (or
any other orchestration tool), we can operationalize the feature
pipeline with the end goal of continuous training (CT).
We will go into all the details of orchestration, scheduling, and CT in
Chapter 11.
Implementing the LLM Twin’s RAG
feature pipeline
The last step is to review the LLM Twin’s RAG feature pipeline code
to see how we applied everything we discussed in this chapter. We
will walk you through the following:
ZenML code
Pydantic domain objects

## Page 261

A custom object-vector mapping (OVM) implementation
The cleaning, chunking, and embedding logic for all our data
categories
We will take a top-down approach. Thus, let’s start with the Settings
class and ZenML pipeline.
Settings
We use Pydantic Settings
(https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_set
tings/) to define a global Settings class that loads sensitive or non-
sensitive variables from a .env file. This approach also gives us all
the benefits of Pydantic, such as type validation. For example, if we
provide a string for the QDRANT_DATABASE_PORT variable instead of
an integer, the program will crash. This behavior makes the whole
application more deterministic and reliable.
Here is what the Settings class looks like with all the variables
necessary to build the RAG feature pipeline:
from pydantic import BaseSettings
class Settings(BaseSettings):
class Config:
env_file = ".env"
env_file_encoding = "utf-8"
# Some other settings

## Page 262

… # Some other settings…
# RAG
TEXT_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID: str = "sentence-trans
RERANKING_CROSS_ENCODER_MODEL_ID: str = "cross
RAG_MODEL_DEVICE: str = "cpu"
# QdrantDB Vector DB
USE_QDRANT_CLOUD: bool = False
QDRANT_DATABASE_HOST: str = "localhost"
QDRANT_DATABASE_PORT: int = 6333
QDRANT_CLOUD_URL: str = "str"
QDRANT_APIKEY: str | None = None
… # More settings…
settings = Settings()
As stated in the internal Config class, all the variables have default
values or can be overridden by providing a .env file.
ZenML pipeline and steps
The ZenML pipeline is the entry point for the RAG feature
engineering pipeline. It reflects the five core phases of RAG
ingestion code: extracting raw documents, cleaning, chunking,
embedding, and loading them to the logical feature store. The calls
within the feature_engineering() function are ZenML steps,
representing a single execution unit performing the five phases of
RAG. The code is available in the GitHub repository at

## Page 263

Figure 4.11 shows how multiple feature engineering pipeline runs
look in ZenML’s dashboard.
Figure 4.11: Feature pipeline runs in the ZenML dashboard

## Page 264

Figure 8.12 shows the DAG of the RAG feature pipeline, where you
can follow all the pipeline steps and their output artifacts. Remember
that whatever is returned from a ZenML step is automatically saved
as an artifact, stored in ZenML’s artifact registry, versioned, and
shareable across the application.

## Page 265

Figure 4.12: Feature pipeline DAG in the ZenML dashboard
The final puzzle piece is understanding how to configure the RAG
feature pipeline dynamically. All its available settings are exposed as
function parameters. Here, we need only a list of author’s names, as
seen in the function’s signature:
feature_engineering(author_full_names: list[str]) . We
inject a YAML configuration file at runtime that contains all the
necessary values based on different use cases. For example, the
following configuration includes a list of all the authors of this book
as we want to populate the feature store with data from all of us
(available in the GitHub repository at
configs/feature_engineering.yaml ):
parameters:
author_full_names:
- Alex Vesa
- Maxime Labonne
- Paul Iusztin
The beauty of this approach is that you don’t have to modify the
code to configure the feature pipeline with different input values. You
have to provide a different configuration file when running it, as
follows:
feature engineering with options(config path " /fe

## Page 266

feature_engineering.with_options(config_path= …/fe
You can either hardcode the path to the config file or provide the
config_path from the CLI, which allows you to modify the
pipeline’s configuration between different runs. Out of simplicity, we
hard-coded the configuration file. Thus, we can call the feature
engineering pipeline calling the run.py script as follows:
python -m tools.run --no-cache --run-feature-engin
However, you can easily add another CLI argument to pass the
config_path variable. Also, you can run the feature pipeline using
the following poe command:
poetry poe run-feature-engineering-pipeline
Let’s move forward to the ZenML steps and sequentially zoom in on
all of them. The source code for all the feature engineering pipeline
steps is available on GitHub at "steps/feature_engineering" .
We will begin with the first step, which involves querying the data
warehouse for new content to process into features.
Querying the data warehouse

## Page 267

The first thing to notice is that a step is a Python function decorated
with @step , similar to how a ZenML pipeline works. The function
below takes as input a list of authors’ full names and performs the
following core steps:
It attempts to get or create a UserDocument instance using the
first and last names, appending this instance to the authors list. If
the user doesn’t exist, it throws an error.
It fetches all the raw data for the user from the data warehouse
and extends the documents list to include these user documents.
Ultimately, it computes a descriptive metadata dictionary logged
and tracked in ZenML.
… # other imports
from zenml import get_step_context, step
@step
def query_data_warehouse(
author_full_names: list[str],
) -> Annotated[list, "raw_documents"]:
documents = []
authors = []
for author_full_name in author_full_names:
logger.info(f"Querying data warehouse for
first_name, last_name = utils.split_user_f
logger.info(f"First name: {first_name}, La
user = UserDocument.get_or_create(first_na
authors append(user)

## Page 268

authors.append(user)
results = fetch_all_data(user)
user_documents = [doc for query_result in
documents.extend(user_documents)
step_context = get_step_context()
step_context.add_output_metadata(output_name="
return documents
The fetch function leverages a thread pool that runs each query on a
different thread. As we have multiple data categories, we have to
make a different query for the articles, posts, and repositories, as
they are stored in different collections. Each query calls the data
warehouse, which is bounded by the network I/O and data
warehouse latency, not by the machine’s CPU. Thus, by moving
each query to a different thread, we can parallelize them. Ultimately,
instead of adding the latency of each query as the total timing, the
time to run this fetch function will be the max between all the calls.
Using threads to parallelize I/O-bounded calls is good practice in
Python, as they are not locked by the Python Global Interpreter
Lock (GIL). In contrast, adding each call to a different process would
add too much overhead, as a process takes longer to spin off than a
thread.
In Python, you want to parallelize things with processes only when
the operations are CPU or memory-bound because the GIL affects

## Page 269

them. Each process has a different GIL. Thus, parallelizing your
computing logic, such as processing a batch of documents or
images already loaded in memory, isn’t affected by Python’s GIL
limitations.
def fetch_all_data(user: UserDocument) -> dict[str
user_id = str(user.id)
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
future_to_query = {
executor.submit(__fetch_articles, user
executor.submit(__fetch_posts, user_id
executor.submit(__fetch_repositories,
}
results = {}
for future in as_completed(future_to_query
query_name = future_to_query[future]
try:
results[query_name] = future.resul
except Exception:
logger.exception(f"'{query_name}'
results[query_name] = []
return results
The _get_metadata() function takes the list of queried documents
and authors and counts the number of them relative to each data
category:

## Page 270

def _get_metadata(documents: list[Document]) -> di
metadata = {
"num_documents": len(documents),
}
for document in documents:
collection = document.get_collection_name(
if collection not in metadata:
metadata[collection] = {}
if "authors" not in metadata[collection]:
metadata[collection]["authors"] = list
metadata[collection]["num_documents"] = me
metadata[collection]["authors"].append(doc
for value in metadata.values():
if isinstance(value, dict) and "authors" i
value["authors"] = list(set(value["aut
return metadata
We will expose this metadata in the ZenML dashboard to quickly see
some statistics on the loaded data. For example, in Figure 4.13, we
accessed the metadata tab of the query_data_warehouse() step,
where you can see that, within that particular run of the feature
pipeline, we loaded 76 documents from three authors. This is
extremely powerful for monitoring and debugging batch pipelines.
You can always extend it with anything that makes sense for your
use case.

## Page 271

Figure 4.13: Metadata of the “query the data warehouse” ZenML
step
Cleaning the documents

## Page 272

In the cleaning step, we iterate through all the documents and
delegate all the logic to a CleaningDispatcher who knows what
cleaning logic to apply based on the data category. Remember that
we want to apply, or have the ability to apply in the future, different
cleaning techniques on articles, posts, and code repositories.
@step
def clean_documents(
documents: Annotated[list, "raw_documents"],
) -> Annotated[list, "cleaned_documents"]:
cleaned_documents = []
for document in documents:
cleaned_document = CleaningDispatcher.disp
cleaned_documents.append(cleaned_document)
step_context = get_step_context()
step_context.add_output_metadata(output_name="
return cleaned_documents
The computed metadata is similar to what we logged in the
query_data_warehouse() step. Thus, let’s move on to chunking
and embedding.
Chunk and embed the cleaned
documents

## Page 273

Similar to how we cleaned the documents, we delegate the chunking
and embedding logic to a dispatcher who knows how to handle each
data category. Note that the chunking dispatcher returns a list
instead of a single object, which makes sense as the document is
split into multiple chunks. We will dig into the dispatcher in the “The
dispatcher layer” section of this chapter.
@step
def chunk_and_embed(
cleaned_documents: Annotated[list, "cleaned_do
) -> Annotated[list, "embedded_documents"]:
metadata = {"chunking": {}, "embedding": {}, "
embedded_chunks = []
for document in cleaned_documents:
chunks = ChunkingDispatcher.dispatch(docum
metadata["chunking"] = _add_chunks_metadat
for batched_chunks in utils.misc.batch(chu
batched_embedded_chunks = EmbeddingDis
embedded_chunks.extend(batched_embedde
metadata["embedding"] = _add_embeddings_metada
metadata["num_chunks"] = len(embedded_chunks)
metadata["num_embedded_chunks"] = len(embedded
step_context = get_step_context()
step_context.add_output_metadata(output_name="
return embedded_chunks

## Page 274

In Figure 4.14, you can see the metadata of the chunking and
embedding ZenML step. For example, you can quickly understand
that we transformed 76 documents into 2,373 chunks, or the
properties we used for chunking articles, such as a chunk_size of
500 and a chunk_overlap of 50.

used to compute the vectors.

As ML systems can break at any time while in production due to
drifts or untreated use cases, leveraging the metadata section to
monitor the ingested data can be a powerful tool that will save
debugging days, translating to tens of thousands of dollars or more
for your business.
Loading the documents to the vector
DB
As each article, post, or code repository sits in a different collection
inside the vector DB, we have to group all the documents based on
their data category. Then, we load each group in bulk in the Qdrant
vector DB:
@step
def load_to_vector_db(
documents: Annotated[list, "documents"],
) -> None:
logger.info(f"Loading {len(documents)} documen
grouped_documents = VectorBaseDocument.group_b
for document_class, documents in grouped_docum
logger.info(f"Loading documents into {docu
for documents batch in utils misc batch(do

## Page 279

for documents_batch in utils.misc.batch(do
try:
document_class.bulk_insert(documen
except Exception:
return False
return True
Pydantic domain entities
Before investigating the dispatchers, we must understand the
domain objects we work with. To some extent, in implementing the
LLM Twin, we are following the domain-driven design (DDD)
principles, which state that domain entities are the core of your
application. Thus, before proceeding, it’s important to understand the
hierarchy of the domain classes we are working with.
The code for the domain entities is available on GitHub
at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering/tree/main/llm_engineering/domain.
We used Pydantic to model all our domain entities. When we wrote
the book, choosing Pydantic was a no-brainer, as it is the go-to
Python package for writing data structures with out-of-the-box type
validation. As Python is a dynamically typed language, using
Pydantic for type validation at runtime makes your system order of

## Page 280

times more robust, as you can be sure that you are always working
with the right type of data.
The domain of our LLM Twin application is split into two dimensions:
The data category: Post, article, and repository
The state of the data: Cleaned, chunked, and embedded
We decided to create a base class for each state of the document,
resulting in having the following base abstract classes:
class CleanedDocument(VectorBaseDocument, ABC)
class Chunk(VectorBaseDocument, ABC)
class EmbeddedChunk(VectorBaseDocument, ABC)
Note that all of them inherit the VectorBaseDocument class, which
is our custom OVM implementation, which we will explain in the next
section of this chapter. Also, it inherits from ABC, which makes the
class abstract. Thus, you cannot initialize an object out of these
classes; you may only inherit from them. That is why base classes
are always marked as abstract.
Each base abstract class from above (which models the state) will
have a subclass that adds the data category dimension. For
example, the CleanedDocument class will have the following
subclasses:

## Page 281

class CleanedPostDocument(CleanedDocument)
class CleanedArticleDocument(CleanedDocument)
class CleanedRepositoryDocument(CleanedDocument)
As we can see in Figure 8.16, we will repeat the same logic for the
Chunk and EmbeddedChunk base abstract classes. We will
implement a specific document class for each data category and
state combination, resulting in nine types of domain entities. For
example, when ingesting a raw document, the cleaning step will yield
a CleanedArticleDocument instance, the chunking step will return
a list of ArticleChunk objects, and the embedding operation will
return EmbeddedArticleChunk instances that encapsulate the
embedding and all the necessary metadata to ingest in the vector
DB.
The same will happen for the posts and repositories.

## Page 282

Figure 4.16: Domain entities class hierarchy and their interaction
We chose this design because the list of states will rarely change,
and we want to extend the list of data categories. Thus, structuring
the classes after the state allows us to plug another data category by
inheriting these base abstract classes.
Let’s see the complete code for the hierarchy of the cleaned
document. All the attributes of a cleaned document will be saved

## Page 283

within the metadata of the vector DB. For example, the metadata of
a cleaned article document will always contain the content, platform,
author ID, author full name, and link of the article.
Another fundamental aspect is the Config internal class, which
defines the name of the collection within the vector DB, the data
category of the entity, and whether to leverage the vector index when
creating the collection:
class CleanedDocument(VectorBaseDocument, ABC):
content: str
platform: str
author_id: UUID4
author_full_name: str
class CleanedPostDocument(CleanedDocument):
image: Optional[str] = None
class Config:
name = "cleaned_posts"
category = DataCategory.POSTS
use_vector_index = False
class CleanedArticleDocument(CleanedDocument):
link: str
class Config:
name = "cleaned_articles"
category = DataCategory.ARTICLES
use_vector_index = False
class CleanedRepositoryDocument(CleanedDocument):

## Page 284

name: str
link: str
class Config:
name = "cleaned_repositories"
category = DataCategory.REPOSITORIES
use_vector_index = False
To conclude this section, let’s also take a look at the base abstract
class of the chunk and embedded chunk:
class Chunk(VectorBaseDocument, ABC):
content: str
platform: str
document_id: UUID4
author_id: UUID4
author_full_name: str
metadata: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)
… # PostChunk, ArticleChunk, RepositoryChunk
class EmbeddedChunk(VectorBaseDocument, ABC):
content: str
embedding: list[float] | None
platform: str
document_id: UUID4
author_id: UUID4
author_full_name: str
metadata: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)
… # EmbeddedPostChunk, EmbeddedArticleChunk, Embed

## Page 285

We also defined an enum that aggregates all our data categories in
a single structure of constants:
class DataCategory(StrEnum):
POSTS = "posts"
ARTICLES = "articles"
REPOSITORIES = "repositories"
The last step to fully understand how the domain objects work is to
zoom into the VectorBaseDocument OVM class.
OVM
The term OVM is inspired by the object-relational mapping (ORM)
pattern we discussed in Chapter 3. We called it OVM because we
work with embedding and vector DBs instead of structured data and
SQL tables. Otherwise, it follows the same principles as an ORM
pattern.
Similar to what we did in Chapter 3, we will implement our own OVM
version. Even if our custom example is simple, it’s a powerful
example of how to write modular and extendable classes by
leveraging OOP best practices and principles.

## Page 286

The full implementation of the VectorBaseDocument
class is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering/blob/main/llm_engineering/domain
/base/vector.py.
Our OVM base class is called VectorBaseDocument . It will support
CRUD operations on top of Qdrant. Based on our application’s
demands, we limited it only to create and read operations, but it can
easily be extended to update and delete functions.
Let’s take a look at the definition of the VectorBaseDocument
class:
from pydantic import UUID4, BaseModel
from typing import Generic
from llm_engineering.infrastructure.db.qdrant impo
T = TypeVar("T", bound="VectorBaseDocument")
class VectorBaseDocument(BaseModel, Generic[T], AB
id: UUID4 = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4)
@classmethod
def from_record(cls: Type[T], point: Record) -
_id = UUID(point.id, version=4)
payload = point.payload or {}
attributes = {
"id": id

## Page 287

id : _id,
**payload,
}
if cls._has_class_attribute("embedding"):
payload["embedding"] = point.vector or
return cls(**attributes)
def to_point(self: T, **kwargs) -> PointStruct
exclude_unset = kwargs.pop("exclude_unset"
by_alias = kwargs.pop("by_alias", True)
payload = self.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_
_id = str(payload.pop("id"))
vector = payload.pop("embedding", {})
if vector and isinstance(vector, np.ndarra
vector = vector.tolist()
return PointStruct(id=_id, vector=vector,
The VectorBaseDocument class inherits from Pydantic’s
BaseModel and helps us structure a single record’s attributes
from the vector DB. Every OVM will be initialized by default with
UUID4 as its unique identifier. Using generics—more precisely, by
inheriting from Generic[T] —the signatures of all the subclasses
of the VectorBaseDocument class will adapt to that given class.
For example, the from_record() method of the Chunk() class,
which inherits VectorBaseDocument , will return the Chunk type,
which drastically helps the static analyzer and type checkers such
as mypy (https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Page 288

The from_record() method adapts a data point from Qdrant’s
format to our internal structure based on Pydantic. On the other
hand, the to_point() method takes the attributes of the current
instance and adapts them to Qdrant’s PointStruct() format. We
will leverage these two methods for our create and read operations.
Ultimately, all operations made to Qdrant will be done through the
connection instance, which is instantiated in the application’s
infrastructure layer.
The bulk_insert() method maps each document to a point.
Then, it uses the Qdrant connection instance to load all the points
to a given collection in Qdrant. If the insertion fails once, it tries to
create the collection and do the insertion again. Often, it is good
practice to split your logic into two functions. One private function
contains the logic, in our case _bulk_insert() , and one public
function handles all the errors and failure scenarios.
class VectorBaseDocument(BaseModel, Generic[T], AB
… # Rest of the class
@classmethod
def bulk_insert(cls: Type[T], documents: list[
try:
cls._bulk_insert(documents)
except exceptions.UnexpectedResponse:
logger info(

## Page 289

logger.info(
f"Collection '{cls.get_collection_
)
cls.create_collection()
try:
cls._bulk_insert(documents)
except exceptions.UnexpectedResponse:
logger.error(f"Failed to insert do
return False
return True
@classmethod
def _bulk_insert(cls: Type[T], documents: list
points = [doc.to_point() for doc in docume
connection.upsert(collection_name=cls.get_
The collection name is inferred from the Config class defined in the
subclasses inheriting the OVM:
class VectorBaseDocument(BaseModel, Generic[T], AB
… # Rest of the class
@classmethod
def get_collection_name(cls: Type[T]) -> str:
if not hasattr(cls, "Config") or not hasat
raise ImproperlyConfigured(
"The class should define a Config
)
return cls.Config.name

## Page 290

Now, we must define a method that lets us read all the records from
the vector DB (without using vector similarity search logic). The
bulk_find() method enables us to scroll (or list) all the records
from a collection. The function below scrolls the Qdrant vector DB,
which returns a list of data points, which are ultimately mapped to
our internal structure using the from_record() method.
The limit parameters control how many items we return at once, and
the offset signals the ID of the point from which Qdrant starts
returning records.
class VectorBaseDocument(BaseModel, Generic[T], AB
… # Rest of the class
@classmethod
def bulk_find(cls: Type[T], limit: int = 10, *
try:
documents, next_offset = cls._bulk_fin
except exceptions.UnexpectedResponse:
logger.error(f"Failed to search docume
documents, next_offset = [], None
return documents, next_offset
@classmethod
def _bulk_find(cls: Type[T], limit: int = 10,
collection_name = cls.get_collection_name(
offset = kwargs.pop("offset", None)
offset = str(offset) if offset else None

## Page 291

offset = str(offset) if offset else None
records, next_offset = connection.scroll(
collection_name=collection_name,
limit=limit,
with_payload=kwargs.pop("with_payload"
with_vectors=kwargs.pop("with_vectors"
offset=offset,
**kwargs,
)
documents = [cls.from_record(record) for r
if next_offset is not None:
next_offset = UUID(next_offset, versio
return documents, next_offset
The last piece of the puzzle is to define a method that performs a
vector similarity search on a provided query embedding. Like before,
we defined a public search() and private _search() method.
The search is performed by Qdrant when calling the
connection.search() function.
class VectorBaseDocument(BaseModel, Generic[T], AB
… # Rest of the class
@classmethod
def search(cls: Type[T], query_vector: list, l
try:
documents = cls._search(query_vector=q
except exceptions UnexpectedResponse:

## Page 292

except exceptions.UnexpectedResponse:
logger.error(f"Failed to search docume
documents = []
return documents
@classmethod
def _search(cls: Type[T], query_vector: list,
collection_name = cls.get_collection_name(
records = connection.search(
collection_name=collection_name,
query_vector=query_vector,
limit=limit,
with_payload=kwargs.pop("with_payload"
with_vectors=kwargs.pop("with_vectors"
**kwargs,
)
documents = [cls.from_record(record) for r
return documents
Now that we understand what our domain entities look like and how
the OVM works, let’s move on to the dispatchers who clean, chunk,
and embed the documents.
The dispatcher layer
A dispatcher inputs a document and applies dedicated handlers
based on its data category (article, post, or repository). A handler can
either clean, chunk, or embed a document.

## Page 293

Let’s start by zooming in on the CleaningDispatcher . It mainly
implements a dispatch() method that inputs a raw document.
Based on its data category, it instantiates and calls a handler that
applies the cleaning logic specific to that data point:
class CleaningDispatcher:
cleaning_factory = CleaningHandlerFactory()
@classmethod
def dispatch(cls, data_model: NoSQLBaseDocumen
data_category = DataCategory(data_model.ge
handler = cls.cleaning_factory.create_hand
clean_model = handler.clean(data_model)
logger.info(
"Data cleaned successfully.",
data_category=data_category,
cleaned_content_len=len(clean_model.co
)
return clean_model
The key in the dispatcher logic is the CleaningHandlerFactory() ,
which instantiates a different cleaning handler based on the
document’s data category:
class CleaningHandlerFactory:
@staticmethod
def create handler(data category: DataCategory

## Page 294

def create_handler(data_category: DataCategory
if data_category == DataCategory.POSTS:
return PostCleaningHandler()
elif data_category == DataCategory.ARTICLE
return ArticleCleaningHandler()
elif data_category == DataCategory.REPOSIT
return RepositoryCleaningHandler()
else:
raise ValueError("Unsupported data typ
The Dispatcher or Factory classes are nothing fancy, but they offer
an intuitive and simple interface for applying various operations to
your documents. When manipulating documents, instead of worrying
about their data category and polluting your business logic with if-
else statements, you have a class dedicated to handling that. You
have a single class that cleans any document, which respects the
DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principles from software engineering. By
respecting DRY, you have a single point of failure, and the code can
easily be extended. For example, if we add an extra type, we must
extend only the Factory class instead of multiple occurrences in the
code.
The ChunkingDispatcher and EmbeddingDispatcher follow the
same pattern. They use a ChunkingHandlerFactory and,
respectively, an EmbeddingHandlerFactory that initializes the

## Page 295

correct handler based on the data category of the input document.
Afterward, they call the handler and return the result.
The source code of all the dispatchers and factories
can be found on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/applicati
on/preprocessing/dispatchers.py
The Factory class leverages theabstract factory creational pattern
(https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-
factory), which instantiates a family of classes implementing the
same interface. In our case, these handlers implement the clean()
method regardless of the handler type.
Also, the Handler class family leverages the strategy behavioral
pattern (https://refactoring.guru/design-
patterns/strategy) used to instantiate when you want to use
different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to
switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
Intuitively, in our dispatcher layer, the combination of the factory and
strategy patterns works as follows:

## Page 296

1. Initially, we knew we wanted to clean the data, but as we knew the
data category only at runtime, we couldn’t decide on what strategy
to apply.
2. We can write the whole code around the cleaning code and
abstract away the logic under a Handler() interface, which will
represent our strategy.
3. When we get a data point, we apply the abstract factory pattern
and create the correct cleaning handler for its data type.
4. Ultimately, the dispatcher layer uses the handler and executes the
right strategy.
By doing so, we:
Isolate the logic for a given data category.
Leverage polymorphism to avoid filling up the code with hundreds
of if-else statements.
Make the code modular and extendable. When a new data
category arrives, we must implement a new handler and modify
the Factory class without touching any other part of the code.
Until now, we have just modeled our entities and how
the data flows in our application. We haven’t written a
single piece of cleaning, chunking, or embedding code.
That is one big difference between a quick demo and a
production-ready application. In a demo, you don’t care

## Page 297

about software engineering best practices and
structuring your code to make it future-proof. However,
writing clean, modular, and scalable code is critical for
its longevity when building a real-world application.
The last component of the RAG feature pipeline is the
implementation of the cleaning, chunking, and embedding handlers.
The handlers
The handler has a one-on-one structure with our domain, meaning
that every entity has its own handler, as shown in Figure 8.17. In
total, we will have nine Handler classes that follow the next base
interfaces:
class CleaningDataHandler()
class ChunkingDataHandler()
class EmbeddingDataHandler()

## Page 298

Figure 4.17: Handler class hierarchy and their interaction
The code for all the handlers is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering/tree/main/llm_engineering/applic
ation/preprocessing.
Let’s examine each handler family and see how it is implemented.

## Page 299

The cleaning handlers
The CleaningDataHandler() strategy interface looks as follows:
… # Other imports.
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
DocumentT = TypeVar("DocumentT", bound=Document)
CleanedDocumentT = TypeVar("CleanedDocumentT", bou
class CleaningDataHandler(ABC, Generic[DocumentT,
@abstractmethod
def clean(self, data_model: DocumentT) -> Clea
pass
Now, for every post, article and repository, we have to implement a
different handler, as follows:
class PostCleaningHandler(CleaningDataHandler):
def clean(self, data_model: PostDocument) -> C
return CleanedPostDocument(
id=data_model.id,
content=clean_text(" #### ".join(data_
… # Copy the rest of the parameters fr
)
class ArticleCleaningHandler(CleaningDataHandler):
def clean(self, data_model: ArticleDocument) -
valid_content = [content for content in da
return CleanedArticleDocument(

## Page 300

return CleanedArticleDocument(
id=data_model.id,
content=clean_text(" #### ".join(valid
platform=data_model.platform,
link=data_model.link,
author_id=data_model.author_id,
author_full_name=data_model.author_ful
)
class RepositoryCleaningHandler(CleaningDataHandle
def clean(self, data_model: RepositoryDocument
return CleanedRepositoryDocument(
id=data_model.id,
content=clean_text(" #### ".join(data_
… # Copy the rest of the parameters fr
)
The handlers input a raw document domain entity, clean the content,
and return a cleaned document. All the handlers use the
clean_text() function to clean the text. Out of simplicity, we used
the same cleaning technique for all the data categories. Still, in a
real-world setup, we would have to further optimize and create a
different cleaning function for each data category. The strategy
pattern makes this a breeze, as we swap the cleaning function in the
handlers, and that’s it.

## Page 301

The cleaning steps applied in the clean_text() function are the
same ones discussed in Chapter 5 in the Creating an instruction
dataset section. We don’t want to repeat ourselves. Thus, for a
refresher, check out that chapter. At this point, we mostly care about
automating and integrating the whole logic into the RAG feature
pipeline. Thus, after operationalizing the ML system, all the cleaned
data used for fine-tuning will be accessed from the logical feature
store, making it the single source of truth for accessing data.
The chunking handlers
First, let’s examine the ChunkingDataHandler() strategy handler.
We exposed the metadata dictionary as a property to aggregate all
the necessary properties required for chunking in a single structure.
By structuring it like this, we can easily log everything to ZenML to
track and debug our chunking logic. The handler takes cleaned
documents as input and returns chunk entities. All the handlers can
be found on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering/tree/main/llm_engineering/application/prepr
ocessing.
… # Other imports.
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
CleanedDocumentT = TypeVar("CleanedDocumentT", bou
ChunkT = TypeVar("ChunkT" bound=Chunk)

## Page 302

ChunkT = TypeVar( ChunkT , bound=Chunk)
class ChunkingDataHandler(ABC, Generic[CleanedDoc
@property
def metadata(self) -> dict:
return {
"chunk_size": 500,
"chunk_overlap": 50,
}
@abstractmethod
def chunk(self, data_model: CleanedDocumentT)
pass
Let’s understand how the ArticleChunkingHandler() class is
implemented. The first step is to override the metadata property and
customize the type of properties the chunking logic requires. For
example, when working with articles, we are interested in the
chunk’s minimum and maximum length.
The handler’s chunk() method inputs cleaned article documents
and returns a list of article chunk entities. It uses the chunk_text()
function to split the cleaned content into chunks. The chunking
function is customized based on the min_length and max_length
metadata fields. The chunk_id is computed as the MD5 hash of the
chunk’s content. Thus, if the two chunks have precisely the same
content, they will have the same ID, and we can easily deduplicate
them. Lastly, we create a list of chunk entities and return them.

## Page 303

class ArticleChunkingHandler(ChunkingDataHandler):
@property
def metadata(self) -> dict:
return {
"min_length": 1000,
"max_length": 1000,
}
def chunk(self, data_model: CleanedArticleDocu
data_models_list = []
cleaned_content = data_model.content
chunks = chunk_article(
cleaned_content, min_length=self.metad
)
for chunk in chunks:
chunk_id = hashlib.md5(chunk.encode())
model = ArticleChunk(
id=UUID(chunk_id, version=4),
content=chunk,
platform=data_model.platform,
link=data_model.link,
document_id=data_model.id,
author_id=data_model.author_id,
author_full_name=data_model.author
metadata=self.metadata,
)
data_models_list.append(model)
return data_models_list

## Page 304

The last step is to dig into the chunk_article() function, which
mainly does two things:
It uses a regex to find all the sentences within the given text by
looking for periods, question marks, or exclamation points
followed by a space. However, it avoids splitting into cases where
the punctuation is part of an abbreviation or initialism (like “ e.g. "
or “ Dr. ")
It groups sentences into a single chunk until the max_length
limit is reached. When the maximum size is reached, and the
chunk size is bigger than the minimum allowed value, it is added
to the final list the function returns.
def chunk_article(text: str, min_length: int, max_
sentences = re.split(r"(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a
extracts = []
current_chunk = ""
for sentence in sentences:
sentence = sentence.strip()
if not sentence:
continue
if len(current_chunk) + len(sentence) <= m
current_chunk += sentence + " "
else:
if len(current_chunk) >= min_length:
extracts.append(current_chunk.stri
current chunk = sentence + " "

## Page 305

current_chunk = sentence +
if len(current_chunk) >= min_length:
extracts.append(current_chunk.strip())
return extracts
The PostChunkingHandler and RepositoryChunkingHandler ,
available on GitHub at
llm_engineering/application/preprocessing/chunking_data
_handlers.py , have a similar structure to the
ArticleChunkingHandler. However, they use a more generic chunking
function called chunk_text() , worth looking into. The
chunk_text() function is a two-step process that has the following
logic:
1. It uses a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter() from
LangChain to split the text based on a given separator or chunk
size. Using the separator, we first try to find paragraphs in the
given text, but if there are no paragraphs or they are too long, we
cut it at a given chunk size.
2. Notice that we want to ensure that the chunk doesn’t exceed the
maximum input length of the embedding model. Thus, we pass all
the chunks created above into a
SenteceTransformersTokenTextSplitter() , which considers
the maximum input length of the model. At this point, we also

## Page 306

apply the chunk_overlap logic, as we want to do it only after we
validate that the chunk is small enough.

chunks_by_tokens.extend(token_splitter.s
return chunks_by_tokens
To conclude, the function above returns a list of chunks that respect
both the provided chunk parameters and the embedding model’s
max input length.
The embedding handlers

## Page 307

The embedding handlers differ slightly from the others as the
EmbeddingDataHandler() interface contains most of the logic. We
took this approach because, when calling the embedding model, we
want to batch as many samples as possible to optimize the inference
process. When running the model on a GPU, the batched samples
are processed independently and in parallel. Thus, by batching the
chunks, we can optimize the inference process by 10x or more,
depending on the batch size and hardware we use.
We implemented an embed() method, in case you want to run the
inference on a single data point, and an embed_batch() method.
The embed_batch() method takes chunked documents as input,
gathers their content into a list, passes them to the embedding
model, and maps the results to an embedded chunk domain entity.
The mapping is done through the map_model() abstract method,
which has to be customized for every data category.

Let’s look only at the implementation of the
ArticleEmbeddingHandler() , as the other handlers are highly
similar. As you can see, we only have to implement the
map_model() method, which takes a chunk of input and computes
the embeddings in batch mode. Its scope is to map this information
to an EmbeddedArticleChunk Pydantic entity.
class ArticleEmbeddingHandler(EmbeddingDataHandler

)
The last step is to understand how the
EmbeddingModelSingleton() works. It is a wrapper over the
SentenceTransformer() class from Sentence Transformers that
initializes the embedding model. Writing a wrapper over external
packages is often good practice. Thus, when you want to change the
third-party tool, you have to modify only the internal logic of the
wrapper instead of the whole code base.
The SentenceTransformer() class is initialized with the
model_id defined in the Settings class, allowing us to quickly

## Page 310

test multiple embedding models just by changing the configuration
file and not the code. That is why I am not insisting at all on what
embedding model to use. This differs constantly based on your use
case, data, hardware, and latency. But by writing a generic class,
which can quickly be configured, you can experiment with multiple
embedding models until you find the best one for you.

The embedding model class implements the singleton pattern
(https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton), a
creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance
while providing a global access point to this instance. The

## Page 312

EmbeddingModelSingleton() class inherits from the
SingletonMeta class, which ensures that whenever an
EmbeddingModelSingleton() is instantiated, it returns the same
instance. This works well with ML models, as you load them once in
memory through the singleton pattern, and afterward, you can use
them anywhere in the code base. Otherwise, you risk loading the
model in memory every time you use it or loading it multiple times,
resulting in memory issues. Also, this makes it very convenient to
access properties such as embedding_size , where you have to
make a dummy forward pass into the embedding model to find the
size of its output. As a singleton, you do this forward pass only once,
and then you have it accessible all the time during the program’s
execution.
Summary
This chapter began with a soft introduction to RAG and why and
when you should use it. We also understood how embeddings and
vector DBs work, representing the cornerstone of any RAG system.
Then, we looked into advanced RAG and why we need it in the first
place. We built a strong understanding of what parts of the RAG can
be optimized and proposed some popular advanced RAG
techniques for working with textual data. Next, we applied everything
we learned about RAG to designing the architecture of LLM Twin’s
RAG feature pipeline. We also understood the difference between a

## Page 313

batch and streaming pipeline and presented a short introduction to
the CDC pattern, which helps sync two DBs.
Ultimately, we went step-by-step into the implementation of the LLM
Twin’s RAG feature pipeline, where we saw how to integrate ZenML
as an orchestrator, how to design the domain entities of the
application, and how to implement an OVM module. Also, we
understood how to apply some software engineering best practices,
such as the abstract factory and strategy software patterns, to
implement a modular and extendable layer that applies different
cleaning, chunking, and embedding techniques based on the data
category of each document.
This chapter focused only on implementing the ingestion pipeline,
which is just one component of a standard RAG application. In
Chapter 9, we will conclude the RAG system by implementing the
retrieval and generation components and integrating them into the
inference pipeline. But first, in the next chapter, we will explore how
to generate a custom dataset using the data we collected and fine-
tune an LLM with it.

Supervised Fine-Tuning
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a crucial step in preparing LLMs
for real-world applications. Following the initial pre-training phase,
where an LLM learns to predict the next token in a sequence, SFT
refines the model’s capabilities using carefully curated pairs of
instructions and corresponding answers. This process serves two
primary purposes: it teaches the model to understand and follow a
specific chat format, effectively transforming it into a conversational
agent, and it allows the model to adapt its broad knowledge base to
excel in targeted tasks or specialized domains.
The importance of SFT lies in its ability to bridge the gap between a
model’s general language understanding and its practical utility. By
exposing the model to examples of desired input-output patterns,
SFT shapes the LLM’s behavior to align with specific goals, whether
they involve task completion (such as summarization or translation)
or domain expertise (like medical or legal knowledge). This tailored
approach not only enhances the model’s performance in intended
areas but also improves its ability to follow instructions and generate
more relevant and coherent responses.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

## Page 318

SFT techniques
Implementing fine-tuning in practice
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create your own
instruction datasets and efficiently fine-tune LLMs on them.
All the code examples from this chapter can be found
on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering.
Creating an instruction dataset
In most use cases, creating an instruction dataset is the most difficult
part of the fine-tuning process. This is due to multiple factors. Most
use cases can be connected to raw text, but it is rare to find natural
pairs of instructions and answers. This raw text needs to be
transformed into a format that includes both instructions and
answers. Moreover, the quality of the data is also crucial. Because of
this, a lot of time is invested in manually checking and verifying
individual samples. This careful review helps ensure that the dataset
is accurate and useful for training the model.

## Page 319

Figure 5.1 – Overview of the post-training data pipeline covered in
this chapter
In this section, we will introduce a general framework to create your
own instruction datasets, regardless of the final use case. We will
then leverage the scraped data from Chapter 3 and transform it into
an instruction dataset. The different stages in our data generation
pipeline are summarized in Figure 5.1.
General framework
Instruction datasets are defined as pairs of instructions and answers.
The instructions are the inputs of the model, used as context during
fine-tuning. The answers are the expected outputs of the model.
During fine-tuning, you can choose to train the model on the
instructions and answers, or on answers only. Pairs of instructions
and answers follow a certain template. Some instruction templates,
such as Alpaca, introduce additional fields like inputs and
system . Both of them can be considered subfields of the

## Page 320

instruction field. In this case, “inputs” contain the data the model
needs to complete the instruction, and “system” is a meta-prompt to
steer the general behavior of the model. Here is an example from the
SlimOrca dataset, with “system” and “instruction”:
System
You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
Think like you are answering to a five year old.
Instruction
Concepts: building, shop, town
Write a sentence that includes all these words.
Output
In our little town, there is a shop inside a big building where
people go to buy their favorite toys and candies.
Table 5.1 – Example of sample from the Open-Orca/SlimOrca
dataset
This example illustrates how the “system” field is used to define
specific behaviors for the model, such as being helpful, always
providing explanations, and tailoring responses as if speaking to a
five-year-old. The “instruction” field provides the necessary data (the

## Page 321

concepts) and the task (constructing a sentence). The output field
shows the expected answer, which, while not the only possible
answer, represents a high-quality response.
To build an instruction dataset, we want to curate data that is
representative of how the model will be used. Once we have
gathered enough samples, our goal is to filter them to only keep
high-quality data. In this context, high-quality data can be described
through three main dimensions:
Accuracy: It refers to the factual correctness and relevance of the
samples. In the context of instruction datasets, this means
ensuring that responses are not only factually accurate but also
relevant to their corresponding instructions. High accuracy is
essential for training models that can provide reliable and
trustworthy information.
Diversity: A high-quality dataset should encompass a wide range
of use cases, covering the potential queries and tasks the
deployed LLM might encounter. This diversity should span topics,
contexts, text lengths, and writing styles. By sampling data in a
representative manner, we allow models to develop robust
instruction-following capabilities.
Complexity: Trivial or overly simplistic samples do little to
improve an LLM’s capabilities. Instead, datasets should include
complex, multi-step reasoning problems and challenging tasks

## Page 322

that push the boundaries of what the model is expected to handle.
This complexity helps in developing models capable of tackling
complex real-world problems.
In the following sections, we will see techniques to filter and evaluate
instruction samples according to these dimensions.
Data quantity
The Hugging Face Hub contains numerous instruction datasets,
which can be general-purpose or designed for particular tasks or
domains. When working on a new use case, it can be beneficial to
look for related open-source datasets to leverage for fine-tuning.
This is particularly important if your number of samples is too low (for
example, fewer than 1,000), requiring you to augment it with high-
quality data.

## Page 323

Figure 5.2 – Screenshot of the most-liked datasets on the Hugging
Face Hub
Calculating an ideal number of samples is a difficult task, as both the
quality of the data and the size of the model can have a dramatic
impact. For large models (around 70 billion parameters, for
example), this number can be as low as 1,000 high-quality samples
(see the LIMA paper in the References section). This is not true for
smaller models (around seven billion parameters, for instance), as
they need more samples to simply learn the correct chat template. In
any case, the quality of the data is a crucial factor, and a high
number of samples is always desirable.

## Page 324

To provide additional numbers, we can look at the fine-tuned models
developed by companies and the open-source community. We can
distinguish two types of finetunes: general-purpose, aimed to
reproduce the capabilities of models like GPT, and task- or domain-
specific models, designed to optimize their performance for a
particular application.
General-purpose models cover more topics, which requires
additional samples. Among companies, we observe a wide range of
values. For instance, Yi models from 01-ai rely on less than 10,000
samples. At the opposite range of the spectrum, Meta reported using
10 million samples for Llama 3 through the entire fine-tuning process
(including preference alignment). In the open-source community,
models like OpenHermes and Dolphin use around one million
samples. Based on the quality of these finetunes, we recommend an
instruction dataset of at least one million samples to create a good
general-purpose instruct model. On the other hand, models fine-
tuned for a specific purpose require fewer samples. Here, we
differentiate task-specific models from domain-specific ones.
Task-specific and domain-specific models represent two distinct
approaches to fine-tuning LLMs. Task-specific models are designed
to excel at a particular function, such as translation, summarization,
or sentiment analysis. These models benefit from a focused training
approach on a single task, allowing for efficient performance even

## Page 325

with smaller model sizes (typically less than 8 billion parameters).
The data required for task-specific fine-tuning is generally more
manageable, ranging from 100 to 100,000 samples. This makes
task-specific fine-tuning an attractive option for many applications
where resources may be limited.
Domain-specific models, on the other hand, aim to tweak the LLM
with specialized knowledge and familiarity with the vocabulary and
linguistic patterns of a particular field. These models are valuable in
areas such as medicine, law, finance, e-commerce, engineering, and
hospitality. The data requirements for domain-specific fine-tuning can
vary widely depending on the complexity and breadth of the domain.
Some fields, like medicine or law, may require as much data as
general-purpose fine-tuning due to their vast technical corpora.
Others, such as e-commerce or hospitality, might need fewer
samples, more in line with task-specific fine-tuning.
The key factors determining the data needs for domain-specific
models are the “size” of the domain (i.e., the extent of its specialized
knowledge and vocabulary) and the representation of that domain in
the model’s pre-training data. Domains that are well-represented in
the original training data may require less fine-tuning, while those
that are more specialized or underrepresented may need more
extensive datasets. Even with open-source LLMs, many pre-training
datasets are closed-source, which requires making educated

## Page 326

guesses to determine their composition (e.g., 30% code or 20%
math).
Data curation
When it comes to procuring data for fine-tuning, the approaches
differ between task-specific and domain-specific models. For task-
specific models, data curation often involves collecting examples of
the desired task from existing datasets or creating new ones. This
might involve gathering pairs of original and summarized texts for a
summarization model or collecting sentences in different languages
for a translation model.
Domain-specific data curation can be more challenging. It often
requires collaboration with subject matter experts to gather and
validate relevant texts, research papers, technical documents, and
other domain-specific content. In some cases, it may involve
partnering with organizations or institutions that have access to large
repositories of specialized information. The quality and relevance of
this data is crucial, as it directly impacts the model’s ability to
understand and generate content in the target domain.
It’s worth noting that few-shot prompting has emerged as an
alternative strategy to fine-tuning, especially for task-specific
applications. This approach leverages the capabilities of large,

## Page 327

powerful models by providing a few examples of the desired task
within the input prompt. While not a replacement for fine-tuning in all
scenarios (e.g., when you want to learn a new domain), few-shot
prompting can be an efficient way to adapt models to new tasks
without the need for extensive additional training.
In practice, the line between task-specific and domain-specific
models can sometimes blur. For instance, a model fine-tuned for
medical diagnosis could be considered both task-specific (focused
on diagnosis) and domain-specific (specialized in medical
knowledge). The key is to understand the primary goal of the fine-
tuning process and tailor the approach accordingly.
At this point in the process, we should have a collection of datasets
suited for our use case. The next step consists of refining the quality
of the samples through rule-based filtering, data duplication, data
decontamination, and data quality evaluation.
Rule-based filtering
Rule-based filtering is a systematic approach to data quality control
that relies on explicit, predefined rules to evaluate and filter data
samples. These rules are typically designed to address common
quality issues and can range from simple checks to more complex
logical operations. The primary goal of rule-based filtering is to

## Page 328

maintain a high standard of data quality by removing samples that do
not meet specific criteria.
Length filtering is a straightforward yet effective rule-based filtering
technique. This method involves setting thresholds for the
acceptable length of responses in the dataset. Extremely short
responses often lack sufficient information to be meaningful, while
excessively long ones may contain irrelevant or redundant content.
It’s important to note that the appropriate length thresholds can vary
significantly depending on the specific task and domain. For
example, a dataset for generating concise summaries might have a
lower maximum threshold compared to one for detailed
explanations.
Keyword exclusion is another powerful rule-based filtering
technique that focuses on the content of the samples rather than
their structure. This method involves creating a list of keywords or
phrases associated with low-quality or inappropriate content, and
then filtering out any samples that contain these terms. The keyword
list can include obvious indicators of low quality, such as profanities
or spam-related terms, as well as domain-specific words that might
indicate irrelevant or off-topic content. For instance, in a dataset for a
professional writing assistant, you might exclude samples containing
slang terms or informal expressions that don’t align with the intended
tone and style.

## Page 329

Format checking is recommended for datasets that include
structured data or follow specific formatting requirements. This
technique ensures that all samples adhere to the expected format,
maintaining consistency and facilitating processing downstream.
Format checking can be particularly important for datasets
containing code samples, JSON structures, or other formatted text.
For example, in a dataset of programming instructions and solutions,
you might implement rules to verify that code samples are
syntactically correct and follow specified style guidelines.
Rule-based filtering offers significant advantages in preparing
instruction datasets. Its speed and efficiency allow for rapid
application to large volumes of data, making it highly scalable. The
consistency of rule application ensures uniform treatment of data,
reducing human error and bias. Furthermore, the explicit definition of
filtering criteria provides transparency and interpretability, facilitating
easy understanding, auditing, and adjustment. The ability to
automate rule-based filtering reduces the need for manual
intervention and enables continuous data quality monitoring.
However, rule-based filtering also has limitations that must be
considered. Predefined rules may lack the nuance required to
capture the full complexity of language and context, potentially
leading to the removal of valid but unusual samples. The typically
binary nature of rules (pass/fail) may not always align with the

## Page 330

nuanced nature of language and instruction quality. Additionally, as
data patterns and quality standards evolve, rules need regular
review and updates to remain effective. There’s also a risk that
poorly designed rules could inadvertently introduce or amplify biases
in the dataset.
Data deduplication
Dataset diversity is fundamental to training models that can
generalize well to new, unseen data. When a dataset contains
duplicates or near-duplicates, it can lead to several issues:
Overfitting: Models may memorize specific examples rather than
learning general patterns.
Biased performance: Overrepresented data points may skew the
model’s performance towards certain types of inputs.
Inefficient training: Redundant data can increase training time
without providing additional valuable information.
Inflated evaluation metrics: Duplicate data in test sets may lead to
overly optimistic performance estimates.
To deduplicate datasets, we distinguish between exact and fuzzy
deduplication. Exact deduplication removes identical samples
through a straightforward process involving data normalization, hash
generation, and duplicate removal. Data normalization standardizes

## Page 331

the format of entries, such as converting text to lowercase. Hash
generation then creates unique hashes for each entry using
algorithms like MD5 or SHA-256. These hashes are compared to
find matches, and duplicates are removed, leaving only one instance
of each. While effective for identical entries, exact deduplication
does not detect near-duplicates or semantically similar content,
requiring more advanced techniques for those cases.
The most popular approach to fuzzy deduplication is MinHash
deduplication. Compared to other fuzzy techniques, it maintains high
accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity.
MinHash operates by generating compact representations, or
signatures, for each data item. These signatures serve as
fingerprints that capture the essence of the data while drastically
reducing its dimensionality. In practice, MinHash transforms data
items (such as text documents) into sets of shingles, applies multiple
hash functions to these sets, and selects the minimum hash values
to form signature vectors. These signatures can then be compared
using similarity measures like Jaccard similarity to efficiently identify
near-duplicates.
In addition to exact and fuzzy deduplication, semantic similarity
takes a different approach by focusing on the meaning of text for
deduplication. This method involves converting words or entire
samples into vector representations using various natural language

## Page 332

processing techniques. Word embedding models such as Word2Vec,
GloVe, and FastText transform individual words into dense vectors,
capturing semantic relationships.
For more context-aware representations, language models like
BERT, sentence transformers, or cross-encoders can generate
embeddings for entire sentences or documents. Once these vector
representations are obtained, deduplication can be performed by
comparing the similarity between vectors. Common similarity
measures include cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Samples
with high similarity scores above a predefined threshold can be
considered duplicates. For large datasets, clustering techniques may
be applied to group similar vectors. Methods like K-means,
DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering can efficiently organize the
vector space, allowing for the identification of clusters that represent
semantically similar content. Within each cluster, a representative
sample can be retained while others are marked as duplicates.
Data decontamination
Data decontamination is the process of ensuring that the training
dataset does not contain samples that are identical or highly similar
to those in the evaluation or test sets. This step is important for
ensuring the quality of the model evaluation and preventing
overfitting or memorization of test data.

## Page 333

Data decontamination uses techniques from data deduplication.
Exact matching can be used to remove any training samples that are
identical to those in the evaluation sets. This can be done using hash
functions or direct string comparisons. Next, we can also use near-
duplicate detection methods to identify and remove training samples
that are very similar to evaluation samples, even if they are not
exactly the same. This often involves techniques like MinHash or
computing similarity scores based on n-grams or embeddings.
A simple way to perform data decontamination is to
add your evaluation set to the instruction dataset
during the data deduplication stage. In this case, we
want to ensure that we only remove samples from the
instruction dataset, which can be implemented in
different ways (only filtering out the first duplicate,
recording the indexes of the evaluation samples, etc.).
Ideally, you can automatically add your evaluation sets
in the data deduplication stage to fully automate this
process. This is particularly efficient if you iterate over
several versions of custom benchmarks.
Another aspect of data decontamination is filtering out samples that
may have been derived from the same source as evaluation data.
This can involve checking for overlapping phrases, similar sentence

## Page 334

structures, or common metadata. Practitioners may also use
provenance tracking (source the data they use) to identify and
exclude data from specific sources that are known to be used in
evaluation sets.
Data quality evaluation
Data quality evaluation is a critical aspect of machine learning,
particularly for LLMs. The process involves assessing various
characteristics of datasets, including accuracy, diversity, and
complexity. While some aspects like mathematical accuracy can be
easily verified using tools such as Python interpreters, evaluating
subjective or open-ended content remains challenging.
Traditional methods of data quality assessment include human
annotation, which generally provides high accuracy but is resource-
intensive. To address scalability issues, machine learning techniques
have been developed to automate the evaluation process. These
include using LLMs as judges, reward models, and classifiers trained
for quality prediction.
The LLM-as-a-judge strategy involves prompting LLMs to evaluate
the quality of each sample. This approach has become popular due
to its flexibility and ease of use, though it does present some
challenges. Different LLMs have different levels of performance

## Page 335

across tasks, and their evaluations often align more closely with
those of non-experts. With domain-specific datasets, you might want
to use domain-specific models instead of better, general-purpose
LLMs. Comparative assessment methods (e.g., “Is answer A better
than answer B?”) generally outperform absolute scoring approaches
(e.g., “Rate answer A between 1 and 4”), though both can be used at
scale with sufficient prompt engineering. We recommend iterating
through different prompts over a representative subset to manually
verify the quality of the responses. Table 5.2 shows an example of a
custom prompt for a judge LLM.
Instruction
You are a data quality evaluator. Your goal is to assess an
instruction and its corresponding answer, determining how
effectively the answer addresses the given task.
In your evaluation, you will provide feedback detailing the
strengths and weaknesses of the answer, followed by a score on
a scale of 1 to 4.
A score of 1 means that the answer is terrible and irrelevant to
the instruction.
A score of 2 means that the answer is not helpful and misses
important aspects of the instruction.
A score of 3 means that the answer is helpful but could be
improved in terms of relevance, accuracy, and depth.

## Page 336

A score of 4 means that the answer is excellent and fully
addresses the task.
Provide your evaluation as follows:
Feedback: (strengths and weaknesses you find relevant)
Score: (number between 1 and 4)
Table 5.2 – Example of LLM-as-a-judge prompt for data quality
evaluation
LLM-as-a-judge is known to have several biases. First, it has a
position bias in comparative scoring, where the LLM judge favors the
first answer. This can be addressed by randomizing the order of
answers A and B. In addition, like humans, LLM judges favor long
answers. Length normalization techniques can be applied to
absolute scoring to mitigate this issue. Finally, LLM judges are
known to have intra-model favoritism, meaning that they prefer
models from the same family (GPT-4o with GPT-4 and GPT-4o mini,
for example). This can be addressed by using several models
instead of a single one.
In general, to improve evaluation reliability, strategies such as using
multiple LLMs as a jury reduce bias and improve consistency.
Leveraging a jury of smaller LLMs can also reduce costs while
increasing accuracy and mitigating intra-model favoritism. For
specific applications like chatbots, it’s advisable to aim for high

## Page 337

agreement between LLM judges and human evaluators (around
80%). Simple grading scales (with few-shot prompting) and task-
specific benchmarks are also recommended to ensure relevant and
interpretable evaluations.
Reward models are another way to re-purpose LLMs for data
quality evaluation. The term “reward model” comes from
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF, see Chapter
6). They can be broadly defined as models that take an instruction
and answer pair and return a score as output. Generally, reward
models are created by adding a linear head on top of a decoder-only
architecture like Gemma or Llama. They are then trained for this
specific purpose, using either reinforcement learning or traditional
fine-tuning. Figure 5.3 shows ArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1’s
architecture, which adds regression and gating layers on top of a
Llama 3 8B model. This model outputs multiple scores to target
specific dimensions, such as helpfulness, correctness, coherence,
complexity, and verbosity. This allows for a more fine-grained
approach to data quality evaluation.

## Page 338

based on Llama 3 (Source:
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.12845)
The Allen Institute for AI’s RewardBench leaderboard, hosted on
Hugging Face (allenai/reward-bench), is a good resource for
comparing different reward models. It combines various types of
reward models (generative, classifiers, DPO, etc.) and evaluates
them on a curated set of chosen and rejected answers for each
instruction. While this task is not directly related to instruction data
quality, it is a good resource for finding models capable of
differentiating between good and bad answers.
Classifiers or encoder-only models can be trained to perform data
quality evaluation. A good example is HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-
classifier, a classifier designed to judge the educational value of web
pages. This model was designed as a quality filter for pretraining

## Page 339

data but a similar approach can be taken to evaluate instruction
samples at scale. In practice, fineweb-edu-classifier adds a
classification head to an embedding model (Snowflake/snowflake-
arctic-embed-m) and trains it for 20 epochs on 450,000 samples that
are annotated by Llama 3 70B Instruct.
This approach relies on encoder-only models, which are both smaller
and better suited to classification tasks. Thanks to their low number
of parameters, these models are faster to run and can scale to
millions of samples. However, they are not as accurate as bigger
models, particularly for complex reasoning tasks where they lack the
ability to capture nuances. At smaller scale, encoder-only models are
still valuable to filter out outliers or as part of an automated data
pipeline, which requires faster processing.
Data exploration
Data exploration is a continuous process that requires practitioners
to become familiar with the training data. It involves both manual
inspection and automated analysis, each playing a crucial role in
understanding the dataset’s characteristics, strengths, and potential
shortcomings.
Manual dataset exploration, though time-consuming, is an
important step. It reveals errors and inconsistencies that automated

## Page 340

processes might miss, including formatting issues, data entry
mistakes, incoherent reasoning, and factual inaccuracies. This
process provides qualitative insights into the dataset’s content and
style. To enhance efficiency, researchers can employ techniques like
stratified sampling (selecting diverse samples), systematic review
(using a criteria checklist), and collaborative review (involving
multiple reviewers).
Figure 5.4 shows an example with Argilla, a collaborative platform for
manual data quality evaluation and exploration.
Figure 5.4 – Argilla’s interface for collaborative data quality
evaluation and exploration

## Page 341

Statistical analysis is a complementary technique that reveals
vocabulary diversity, potential biases, and concept representation.
This process utilizes natural language processing libraries like NLTK
or spaCy for tokenization and analysis of large text volumes.
Visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn create histograms
and word clouds, enabling intuitive pattern recognition. These
techniques provide insights into dataset composition, language
breadth, and possible cultural or contextual preferences, which can
influence model outputs.
Topic clustering automatically groups similar documents or pieces
of text together, revealing underlying themes and patterns within the
data. This process is especially important for understanding the
content of large text corpora, identifying trends, and organizing
information in a meaningful way. It is often associated with data
visualization, with figures that show clusters of similar samples.
Let’s consider the task of building an instruction dataset about
various programming languages. You have collected a vast corpus of
programming-related text from online forums, documentation, and
tutorials. First, topic clustering can help identify the distinct
programming languages present in the dataset (Python, JavaScript,
etc.). Second, within each language cluster, you can further identify
sub-topics like error handling , data structures , and web

## Page 342

frameworks . This allows a balanced representation of each
language and sub-topic in the corpus.
This makes sure that each topic is correctly covered for each
programming language.

## Page 343

Figure 5.5 – Representation of the historical TikTok dataset made
with Nomic Atlas
Several tools are available for performing topic clustering, each with
its own strengths and approaches. For example, Hugging Face’s
text-clustering provides a simple pipeline with sentence transformers
for embedding text into vector space, UMAP for dimensionality
reduction, and DBSCAN for clustering. It also automatically labels
clusters using an LLM and can output visualizations. Nomic Atlas
(see Figure 5.5), BunkaTopics, and Lilac are alternatives proposing
similar approaches with additional features.
Data generation
When the available instruction datasets are not sufficient, creating
custom data becomes necessary. This is particularly relevant for
specialized applications where publicly available data is scarce.
Additionally, it serves as a method to augment underrepresented
areas in a dataset, like insufficient examples of JavaScript error-
handling techniques in our previous example. While data can be
generated manually by individuals or through crowdsourcing, these
approaches often incur significant costs and time investments.
Synthetic data generation using LLMs offers a more efficient and
scalable alternative. This method, when combined with well-

## Page 344

designed prompt engineering, can produce high-quality data at a
much larger scale, effectively addressing the limitations of manual
data creation processes.
The process of synthetic data generation typically begins with the
preparation of a set of carefully designed prompts (sometimes called
taxonomy). These serve as the foundation for generating new,
diverse examples. Five seed prompts used in the original Alpaca
dataset can be seen in Table 5.3. The quality of synthetically
generated data largely depends on the prompts and techniques used
in the generation process. Well-crafted prompts can guide the
language model to produce diverse, relevant, and high-quality
instruction-response pairs. These prompts often include specific
instructions, examples, and constraints to ensure the generated data
aligns with the desired format and content.
Seed instructions
Is there anything I can eat for breakfast that doesn’t include
eggs, yet includes protein, and has roughly 700-1000
calories?
What is the relation between the given pairs? Input: Night :
Day :: Right : Left
Generate a one-sentence description for each of the following
people. Input: -Barack Obama\n- Elon Musk\n- Taylor Swift

## Page 345

Describe a situation in which the given stereotype can harm
you. Input: All Asians are smart!
Generate an appropriate subjective title for the following
email: Input: “Hi [person name],\n\nI’m writing to ask you if
you are happy to be a panelist in our workshop on
multimodality at CVPR. The workshop will be held on June 20,
2023. \n\nBest,\n[my name]
Table 5.3 – Examples of seed prompts used in the original Alpaca
dataset
Many synthetic data generation pipelines incorporate multiple steps
to ensure data quality. This may include generating an initial set of
questions or instructions, followed by generating corresponding
answers or responses. Some systems also implement validation
steps, where another model or set of rules checks the generated
pairs for accuracy, relevance, and adherence to specified criteria.
An important aspect of synthetic data generation is the ability to
control various attributes of the generated data. This includes factors
such as the complexity of the instructions, the length of the
responses, the tone or style of the language used, and the specific
topics or domains covered. By fine-tuning these parameters, it’s
possible to create datasets that are tailored to specific training

## Page 346

objectives or that complement existing datasets in targeted ways.
Structured generation using libraries like Outlines can also be
beneficial to adhere to specific formats.
Furthermore, synthetic data generation can be particularly useful for
addressing biases and gaps in existing datasets. By carefully
designing the generation process, it’s possible to create more
balanced and inclusive datasets that represent a wider range of
perspectives, topics, and language styles. This can help in training
LLMs that are more equitable and capable of serving diverse user
bases.
However, synthetic data generation also comes with challenges. One
primary concern is the potential for the generated data to inherit
biases or errors from the underlying language model used for
generation. To mitigate this, many approaches incorporate human
oversight, diverse prompts, and additional filtering mechanisms to
ensure the quality and appropriateness of the generated data.
Another consideration is the need for the generated data to be
sufficiently diverse and challenging. If the synthetic data is too
simplistic or repetitive, it may not provide the level of complexity
required to train a robust LLM. Advanced techniques in synthetic
data generation often focus on creating varied and nuanced

## Page 347

instruction-response pairs that can push the boundaries of what the
model can learn.
Data augmentation
In this context, data augmentation refers to the process of increasing
both the quantity and the quality of data samples. Unlike data
generation, we use pre-existing instruction samples as inputs in this
stage. While it is possible to upsample pairs of instructions and
answers, data augmentation is mostly used to increase the quality of
existing samples. In particular, it focuses on two aspects: diversity
and complexity.
A pioneering approach in this field is the Evol-Instruct method, which
uses LLMs to evolve simple instructions into more qualitative ones.
The evolved instructions can then be used to generate answers
using powerful LLMs. This method employs two main strategies: in-
depth and in-breadth evolving.
In-depth evolving focuses on enhancing the complexity of existing
instructions. It includes several techniques:
Constraints: It involves introducing additional requirements or
limitations to the original instruction, making it more challenging to
fulfill.

## Page 348

Deepening: Instead of shallow questions, it tries to find more
deep questions, requiring more comprehensive responses.
Concretizing: It replaces general concepts with more specific
ones, adding detail and precision to the instruction.
Increasing reasoning steps: It modifies instructions to explicitly
request multiple-step reasoning, promoting more complex
problem-solving.
Complicating input: This involves adding more complex data
formats or structures to the instruction, such as XML, JSON, or
code snippets.
In-breadth evolving, on the other hand, aims to expand the
diversity of the instruction dataset. It generates entirely new
instructions inspired by existing ones, focusing on creating more rare
or long-tailed examples within the same domain.
As an example of concrete implementation, in-depth evolving can be
automated with the following prompt, from the AutoEvol paper. You
simply need to provide the instruction you want to evolve as input,
and a powerful model like GPT-4o will return a more complex version
of the original instruction.
You are an Instruction Rewriter that rewrites the given
#Instruction# into a more complex version. Please follow the

## Page 349

steps below to rewrite the given “#Instruction#” into a more

Table 5.4 – Evol LLM prompt from the “Automatic Instruction
Evolving for Large Language Models” paper by Zeng et al. (2024)
The UltraFeedback method is another innovative approach,
focused on answer quality instead of instruction quality. It employs AI
feedback to enhance the quality and diversity of model responses.
Unlike Evol-Instruct, which evolves instructions, UltraFeedback uses
a large pool of diverse instructions and models to generate a wide
range of responses.
It then leverages advanced language models like GPT-4 to provide
detailed critiques and numerical scores for these responses across
multiple dimensions such as instruction-following, truthfulness,
honesty, and helpfulness.
Based on these ideas, you can create your own augmentation
techniques to create a more challenging and diverse instruction
dataset. By refining and evolving existing instructions and answers,
the resulting dataset can better train models to handle complex,

## Page 351

multi-step tasks, and improve their performance across a wider
range of applications.
Creating our own instruction dataset
In this section, we will create our own instruction dataset based on
the crawled data from Chapter 3. To create a high-quality instruction
dataset, we need to address two main issues: the unstructured
nature of our data and the limited number of articles we can crawl.
This unstructured nature comes from the fact that we are dealing
with raw text (articles), instead of pairs of instructions and answers.
To address this issue, we will use an LLM to perform this
transformation. Specifically, we will employ a combination of
backtranslation and rephrasing. Backtranslation refers to the process
of providing the expected answer as output and generating its
corresponding instruction. However, using a chunk of text like a
paragraph as an answer might not always be appropriate. This is
why we want to rephrase the raw text to ensure we’re outputting
properly formatted, high-quality answers. Additionally, we can ask
the model to follow the author’s writing style to stay close to the
original paragraph. While this process involves extensive prompt
engineering, it can be automated and used at scale, as we will see in
the following implementation.

## Page 352

Our second issue regarding the limited number of samples is quite
common in real-world use cases. The number of articles we can
retrieve is limited, which constrains the size of the instruction dataset
we are able to create. In this example, the more samples we have,
the better the model becomes at imitating the original authors. To
address this problem, we will divide our articles into chunks and
generate three instruction-answer pairs for each chunk. This will
multiply the number of samples we create while maintaining diversity
in the final dataset. For simplicity, we will do it using OpenAI’s GPT-
4o-mini model, but you can also use open-source models.
However, LLMs are not reliable when it comes to producing
structured output. Even when given specific templates or
instructions, there’s no guarantee that the model will consistently
adhere to them. This inconsistency often necessitates additional
string parsing to ensure the output meets the desired format.
To simplify this process and ensure properly structured results, we
can employ structured generation techniques. Structured generation
is an effective method to force an LLM to follow a predefined
template, such as JSON, pydantic classes, or regular expressions. In
the following, we will use OpenAI’s JSON mode feature, which
provides a more robust way to return valid JSON objects and reduce
the need for extensive post-processing.

## Page 353

Based on this description, the following figure summarizes every
step of the synthetic data pipeline we want to build.
Figure 5.6 – Synthetic data generation pipeline from raw text to
instruction dataset
Let’s now implement it in Python. You can implement it as part of the
LLMOps pipeline, or as a standalone script:
1. We want to make sure that the following libraries are installed.
The OpenAI library will allow us to interact with a model to
generate the instruction data, and datasets will format it into a
Hugging Face-compatible format. The tqdm library is installed to
visualize the progress during the data generation process.

## Page 354

openai==1.37.1
datasets==2.20.0
tqdm==4.66.4
2. We import all the required libraries as follows.
import concurrent.futures
import json
import random
import re
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecuto
from typing import List, Tuple
from datasets import Dataset
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
3. The raw data we have is a JSON file. We create a Hugging Face
dataset from this JSON file by extracting specific fields from each
article: id , content , platform , author_id , author name ,
and link .
def load_articles_from_json(file_path: str) -> D
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
data = json.load(file)
return Dataset from dict(

## Page 355

return Dataset.from_dict(
{
"id": [item["id"] for item in data["

}
)
If we simply load our dataset as a pandas dataframe, it returns the
following table.

## Page 360

1. If we inspect the content of some articles a little further, we realize
that some of them have special characters and redundant
whitespaces. We can clean this with a simple regex.
First, we use [^\w\s.,!?'] to remove non-alphanumeric
characters except for apostrophes, periods, commas, exclamation
marks, and question marks. Then, we use \s+ to replace multiple
consecutive whitespace characters with a single space.
Finally, we implement strip() to remove any leading or trailing
whitespace.
def clean_text(text):
text = re.sub(r"[^\w\s.,!?']", " ", text)

## Page 361

text = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", text)
return text.strip()
5. Now that we can load our articles, we need to chunk them before
turning them into pairs of instructions and answers. Ideally, you
would want to use headlines or paragraphs to produce
semantically meaningful chunking.
However, in our example, like in the real world, raw data tends to be
messy. Due to improper formatting, we cannot extract paragraphs or
headlines for every article in our raw dataset. Instead, we will extract
sentences using a regex to get chunks between 1,000 and 2,000
characters. This number can be optimized depending on the density
of the information contained in the text.
The extract_substrings function processes each article in the
dataset by first cleaning the text and then using a regex to split it into
sentences. It then builds chunks of text by concatenating these
sentences until each chunk is between 1,000 and 2,000 characters
long.
def extract_substrings(dataset: Dataset, min_lengt
extracts = []
sentence_pattern = r"(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z
for article in dataset["content"]:
cleaned article = clean text(article)

## Page 362

cleaned_article = clean_text(article)
sentences = re.split(sentence_pattern, cle
current_chunk = ""
for sentence in sentences:
sentence = sentence.strip()
if not sentence:
continue
if len(current_chunk) + len(sentence)
current_chunk += sentence + " "
else:
if len(current_chunk) >= min_lengt
extracts.append(current_chunk.
current_chunk = sentence + " "
if len(current_chunk) >= min_length:
extracts.append(current_chunk.strip())
return extracts
6. Next, we want to create instruction-answer pairs from the
extracted chunks of text. To manage these pairs effectively, we
introduce the InstructionAnswerSet class. This class allows
us to create instances directly from JSON strings, which is useful
when parsing the output from the OpenAI API.
class InstructionAnswerSet:
def __init__(self, pairs: List[Tuple[str, st
self.pairs = pairs
@classmethod

## Page 363

@classmethod
def from_json(cls, json_str: str) -> 'Instru
data = json.loads(json_str)
pairs = [(pair['instruction'], pair['ans
for pair in data['instruction_a
return cls(pairs)
def __iter__(self):
return iter(self.pairs)
7. Now that we have a set of extracts from the articles with a
reasonable length, we can use an LLM to transform them into
pairs of instructions and answers. Note that this step is model-
agnostic and can be implemented with any open-source or
closed-source model. Because this output is grounded in the
context we provide, it doesn’t require complex reasoning or high-
performing models.
For convenience, we will use GPT-4o mini in this example. This
choice is motivated by the low cost and good performance of this
model. Prompt engineering is the most important aspect of this data
transformation stage and requires several iterations to produce the
expected outputs. We recommend starting with simple prompts and
adding complexity when required to be more accurate, modify the
style, or output multiple responses.

## Page 364

In our example, we want to create instructions like “Write a
paragraph about X topic” and corresponding answers that are factual
and imitate the writer’s style. To implement this, we need to provide
an extract that will ground the model’s responses. For efficiency, we
also choose to generate five instruction-answer pairs for each
extract. Here’s the beginning of our function for instruction
generation, including our prompt.
def generate_instruction_answer_pairs(
extract: str, client: OpenAI
) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
prompt = f"""Based on the following extract, g

"""
8. In addition to the user prompt, we can also specify a system
prompt to guide the model into generating the expected
instructions. Here, we repeat our high-level task in the system
prompt.
The concatenation of the system and user prompts is fed to the
OpenAI API, using the GPT-4o mini model in JSON mode and a
maximum of 1,200 tokens in the answer. We also use a standard
temperature of 0.7 to encourage diverse responses. The generated
text is directly parsed using the InstructionAnswerSet class to return
pairs of instructions and answers.
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o-mini",
messages=[
{
"role": "system", "content": "You

}

},
{"role": "user", "content": prompt},

max_tokens=1200,
temperature=0.7,
)
# Parse the structured output
result = InstructionAnswerSet.from_json(comple
# Convert to list of tuples
return result.pairs
9. Let’s create a main function to automate the process. It extracts
substrings from the input dataset, then uses concurrent
processing via Python’s ThreadPoolExecutor to efficiently
generate instruction-answer pairs for each extract.
We use a default max_workers value of 4 because higher values
tend to exceed OpenAI’s rate limits, potentially causing API request
failures or throttling.
def create_instruction_dataset(
dataset: Dataset, client: OpenAI, num_workers:
) -> Dataset:
extracts = extract_substrings(dataset)
instruction_answer_pairs = []
with concurrent futures ThreadPoolExecutor(max

):

return Dataset.from_dict(
{"instruction": list(instructions), "outpu
)
10. We can create our instruction dataset by calling this function.
Running it over the raw data with GPT-4o mini costs less than
0.5$.
11. We can now create a main function to orchestrate the entire
pipeline. It loads the raw data, creates the instruction dataset,
splits it into training and testing sets, and pushes the result to the
Hugging Face Hub.
def main(dataset_id: str) -> Dataset:
client = OpenAI()
# 1. Load the raw data
raw_dataset = load_articles_from_json("clean
print("Raw dataset:")
print(raw_dataset.to_pandas())
# 2 Create instructiondataset

## Page 368

# 2. Create instructiondataset
instruction_dataset = create_instruction_dataset
print("Instruction dataset:")
print(instruction_dataset.to_pandas())
# 3. Train/test split and export
filtered_dataset = instruction_dataset.train
filtered_dataset.push_to_hub("mlabonne/llmtw
return filtered_dataset
Dataset({
features: ['instruction', 'output'],
num_rows: 3335
})
We obtained 3,335 pairs with this process. You can find our version
of the dataset at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/llmtwin. The
Hugging Face Hub provides a convenient dataset viewer (see Figure
5.7) to explore instructions and answers and make sure that there
are no obvious mistakes in these samples. Due to the small size of
the dataset, there is no need for comprehensive exploration and
topic clustering.

## Page 369

Figure 5.7 – The mlabonne/llmtwin instruction dataset on the
Hugging Face Hub
As seen in the previous section, we could refine this instruction
dataset by increasing the diversity and complexity of our samples.
More advanced prompt engineering could also increase the quality
of the generated data by providing examples of the expected results,
for instance. Finally, quality evaluation could help filter out low-quality
samples by reviewing them individually. For conciseness and
simplicity, we will keep a straightforward approach for this instruction
dataset and explore more advanced methods in Chapter 6 when we
create a preference dataset.
In the next section, we will introduce SFT techniques, as well as
related concepts.

## Page 370

Exploring SFT and its techniques
SFT consists of re-training pre-trained models on a smaller dataset
composed of pairs of instructions and answers. The goal of SFT is to
turn a base model, which can only perform next-token prediction,
into a useful assistant, capable of answering questions and following
instructions. SFT can also be used to improve the general
performance of the base model (general-purpose SFT), instill new
knowledge (e.g., new languages, domains, etc.), focus on specific
tasks, adopt a particular voice, and so on.
In this section, we will discuss when to use fine-tuning and explore
related concepts with storage formats and chat templates. Finally,
we will introduce three popular ways of implementing SFT: full-
finetuning, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantization-aware
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA).
When to fine-tune
In most scenarios, it is recommended to start with prompt
engineering instead of directly fine-tuning models. Prompt
engineering can be used with either open-weight or closed-source
models. By using techniques like few-shot prompting or retrieval
augmented generation (RAG), numerous problems can efficiently
be tackled without SFT. Prompt engineering also allows us to build a
robust evaluation pipeline, which measures metrics like accuracy,

## Page 371

but also cost and latency. If these results do not match the
requirements, we can explore the possibility of creating an
instruction dataset, as illustrated in the previous section. If enough
data is available, fine-tuning becomes an option.
Figure 5.8 – Basic flowchart to determine when fine-tuning is an
option on a technical level
Beyond these technical considerations, SFT answers common
needs in terms of control (“know your data”) and customizability (the
fine-tuned model is unique). Instead of building applications around a
chatbot, fine-tuning allows developers to create more diverse
interactions with LLMs, like tool analytics, moderation, and additional
context. Note that if we focus on open-weight models in this book,
several LLM providers offer automated fine-tuning services. While
they don’t offer the same level of control and customizability as
managing your own fine-tuning pipeline, it can be an interesting

## Page 372

trade-off in specific scenarios (e.g., limited resources in terms of
machine learning engineering).
Despite these advantages, fine-tuning also has limitations. It is
generally understood that SFT leverages pre-existing knowledge in
the base model’s weights and refocuses the parameters for a
specific purpose. This has several implications. First of all,
knowledge that is too distant from what has been learned in the pre-
training set (such as an unknown or rare language) can be difficult to
learn effectively.
Even worse, a study showed that fine-tuning a model on new
knowledge could result in more frequent hallucinations. Depending
on the SFT technique that is used, we’re also at risk of erasing
knowledge that was present in the base model (a common issue
referred to as “catastrophic forgetting”).
Instruction dataset formats
Instruction datasets are stored in a particular format to organize
instructions and answers. Typically, each sample in the dataset can
be represented as a Python dictionary, where keys are prompt types
like system , instruction , output , and values corresponding to
the actual text. The three most standard formats are Alpaca,

## Page 373

ShareGPT, and OpenAI. The following table shows how these data
formats are generally organized.
Name JSONL format
Alpaca {“instruction”: “...”, “input”: “...”, “output”: “...”}
{“instruction”: “...”, “output”: “...”}
ShareGPT {“conversations”: [{“from”: “...”, “value”: “...”}, …]}
OpenAI {“conversations”: [{“role”: “...”, “content”: “...”}, …]}
OASST {“INSTRUCTION”: “...”, “RESPONSE”: “...”}
Raw text {“text”: “...”}
Table 5.5 – Examples of instruction data storage format
Note that for Alpaca, the “ input " key is optional. The content of the
“ input " key is only appended to the content of the “ instruction "
key when it exists. We also added the “ raw text " data format to
show that SFT is not inherently different from pre-training. If you
choose to re-train a model on raw text, this is a type of fine-tuning
generally called “continual pre-training.”

## Page 374

The dataset we created in the previous section has two columns
(“ instruction " and “ output ") and corresponds to the Alpaca
format. Alpaca is sufficient for single-turn instructions and answers,
which means it is limited to one instruction and one answer. When
you want to process conversations (multiple instructions and
answers), formats like ShareGPT or OpenAI are a better fit. By
storing each message as a dictionary in a list, they can represent an
arbitrarily long conversation in each sample.
The choice of single-turn and multi-turn conversations directly
impacts the storage type and depends on the end use case.
Chat templates
Once the instruction-answer pairs are parsed from the dataset
format, we want to structure them in a chat template. Chat templates
offer a unified way to present the instructions and answers to the
model.
In general, they also include special tokens to identify the beginning
and the end of a message, or who is the author of the message.
Since base models are not designed to follow instructions, they don’t
have a chat template. This means that you can choose any template
when you fine-tune a based model. If you want to fine-tune an

## Page 375

instruct model (not recommended), you need to use the same
template or it might degrade your performance.
Like instruction dataset formats, there are different chat templates:
ChatML, Llama 3, Mistral, and many others. In the open-source
community, the ChatML template (originally from OpenAI) is a
popular option. It simply adds two special tokens (<|im_start|>
and <|im_end|> ) to indicate who is speaking. To give you an
example, here is what we obtain when we apply the ChatML
template to the instruction-answer pair shown in Table 5.1:
<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant, who always provide expl
<|im_start|>user
Concepts: building, shop, town
Write a sentence that includes all these words.<|im_
<|im_start|>assistant
In our little town, there is a shop inside a big bui
Table 5.6 – Sample from Table 5.1 with the ChatML chat template

## Page 376

As you can see, we still have three distinct parts: system, user, and
assistant. Each part starts with the <|im_start|> token and ends
with <|im_end|>. The current speaker is identified by a string (like
“ system ") instead of a special token. This is the exact string that is
tokenized and used as input by the model during fine-tuning.
However, during inference, we can’t provide the expected answer. In
this case, we provide the system and user part as shown in Figure
5.6, and prompt the model to answer by adding
<|im_start|>assistant\n .
Because the model has been fine-tuned with this template, it
understands that the next tokens should be an answer relevant to
the user instruction and guided by the system prompt. This is how
fine-tuned models acquire instruction-following capabilities.
A common issue with chat templates is that every single whitespace
and line break is extremely important. Adding or removing any
character would result in a wrong tokenization, which negatively
impacts the performance of the model. For this reason, it is
recommended to use reliable templates like Jinja, as implemented in
the Transformers library. Table 5.7 shows a few examples of such
templates, including Alpaca, which is both the name of an instruction
dataset format and a chat template.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
While many techniques exist in the literature, SFT has converged on
three main techniques: full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA. We will
introduce each technique individually, and weigh their pros and cons
depending on your use cases.

## Page 379

Figure 5.9 – Architectural differences of the three main SFT
techniques at the module level
Full fine-tuning
Full fine-tuning refers to the most straightforward SFT technique,
consisting of re-training every parameter in the base model. Like pre-
training, SFT uses next-token prediction as its training objective. This
means that the previously discussed structure of the dataset can be
seen as the main difference between continual pre-training and full
fine-tuning.
This method often provides the best results but requires significant
computational resources. Memory usage depends on several
factors, including model size, training techniques, and optimization
methods. At its simplest, using a single-GPU setting, the memory
required can be estimated using the following formula:

## Page 380

For a basic setup using 32-bit floating point (fp32) precision, we
can estimate:
Parameters: Learnable weights and biases within a neural
network. In a large language model, these are typically the
weights in the attention mechanisms, feed-forward layers, and
embedding layers. Cost: 4 bytes/parameter (FP32) or 2
bytes/parameter (FP16/BF16).
Gradients: Gradients are the partial derivatives of the loss
function with respect to each model parameter. They indicate how
much each parameter should be adjusted to minimize the loss.
During training, gradients are computed for each parameter
through backpropagation and are used to update the model
parameters. Cost: 4 bytes/parameter.
Optimizer states: Optimizer states are additional values
maintained by optimization algorithms like Adam or AdamW.
These typically include running averages of past gradients and
past squared gradients for each parameter. They help in adapting
the learning rate for each parameter and navigating the loss
landscape more effectively. For instance, Adam maintains two
additional values (momentum and variance) per parameter. Cost:
8 bytes/parameter (for Adam optimizer).
Activations: Activations are the intermediate outputs of each
layer in the neural network during the forward pass. For
transformer-based models, this includes the outputs of attention

## Page 381

mechanisms, feed-forward layers, and normalization layers.
Activations need to be kept in memory during the forward pass to
compute gradients in the backward pass, unless techniques like
activation checkpointing are used. Cost: variable, but often
negligible for small batch sizes.
This gives us a baseline of 16 bytes per parameter. This translates
into 112 GB of VRAM for a 7 B model and 1,120 GB for a 70 B
model. However, this is often an underestimate, as it doesn’t account
for additional memory needed for activations, temporary buffers, and
overhead from various training techniques.
Several techniques can be employed to reduce memory usage
during LLM fine-tuning. Model parallelism spreads the workload
across multiple GPUs, though it adds some overhead. Gradient
accumulation enables larger effective batch sizes without
proportional memory increase. Memory-efficient optimizers like 8-bit
Adam can reduce the footprint of optimizer states. Activation
checkpointing trades computation for memory by recalculating
certain activations. When combined, these techniques can
significantly lower memory usage. For instance, using mixed
precision with model parallelism might reduce costs to around 14-15
bytes per parameter, compared to the 16-byte baseline. However,
memory requirements remain substantial for large models even with
these optimizations.

## Page 382

In addition, full fine-tuning directly modifies the pre-training weights,
which makes it destructive by nature. If training doesn’t behave as
expected, it might erase previous knowledge and skills – a
phenomenon referred to as “catastrophic forgetting.” The same
phenomenon can happen with continual pre-training, which generally
makes these techniques more difficult to use. Due to this additional
complexity and its high computational requirements, parameter-
efficient techniques are often preferred to full fine-tuning to create
task and domain-specific models.
LoRA
LoRA is a parameter-efficient technique for fine-tuning LLMs.
Developed to address the computational challenges associated with
adapting massive neural networks, LoRA has quickly become a
cornerstone technique in LLM fine-tuning.
The primary purpose of LoRA is to enable the fine-tuning of LLMs
with significantly reduced computational resources. This is achieved
by introducing trainable low-rank matrices that modify the behavior of
the model without changing its original parameters. The key
advantages of LoRA include:
Dramatically reduced memory usage during training
Faster fine-tuning process
Preservation of pre-trained model weights (non-destructive)

## Page 383

Ability to switch between tasks efficiently by swapping LoRA
weights
These benefits have made LoRA particularly attractive for
researchers and developers working with limited computational
resources, effectively democratizing the process of LLM fine-tuning.
At its core, LoRA employs a low-rank decomposition technique to
update model weights efficiently. Instead of directly modifying the
original weight matrix , LoRA introduces two smaller matrices,
and , which together form a low-rank update to .

## Page 384

Figure 5.10 – LoRA adds the two trainable matrices and and
keeps the pre-trained weights frozen
Mathematically, this can be represented as:
Here, is the original weight matrix, and are the LoRA matrices,
and is the effective weight matrix used during inference.
The dimensions of matrices A and B are chosen such that their
product has the same shape as , but with a much lower rank. This
rank, typically denoted as , is a crucial hyperparameter in LoRA.
During training, the original weights remain frozen, while only
and are updated. This approach significantly reduces the number
of trainable parameters, leading to substantial memory savings and
faster training times.
To implement LoRA effectively, we need to select the correct
hyperparameters and target modules. LoRA comes with two
hyperparameters:
Rank ( ): Determines the size of the LoRA matrices. A common
starting point is , but values up to 256 have shown good
results in some cases. Larger ranks may capture more diverse
tasks but could lead to overfitting.

## Page 385

Alpha ( ): A scaling factor applied to the LoRA update. In
practice, we update the frozen weights by a factor of . This
is why a common heuristic is to set to twice the value of ,
effectively applying a scaling factor of 2 to the LoRA update. You
can experiment with different ratios in case of overfitting or
underfitting.
In addition, it is possible to add a drop-out layer to prevent
overfitting. The dropout rate is usually set between 0 and 0.1 as an
optional regularization factor, which slightly decreases training
speed.
LoRA can be applied to various parts of the model architecture.
Initially, LoRA was primarily focused on modifying the attention
mechanism, specifically the query (Q) and value (V) matrices in
transformer layers. However, experiments have demonstrated
significant benefits in extending LoRA’s application to other key
components of the model. These additional target modules include:
Key (K) matrices in attention layers
Output projection layers (often denoted as O) in attention
mechanisms
Feed-forward or Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) blocks between
attention layers

## Page 386

Linear output layers
However, it’s important to note that increasing the number of LoRA-
adapted modules also increases the number of trainable parameters
and, consequently, the memory requirements.
Using LoRA, it’s possible to fine-tune a 7B parameter model on a
single GPU with as little as 14-18 GB of VRAM, depending on the
specific configuration. This is a dramatic reduction compared to full
fine-tuning, which would typically require multiple high-end GPUs. In
terms of trainable parameters, LoRA drastically reduces the number
compared to full fine-tuning. For example, even when targeting every
module with a rank of 16, a Llama 3 8 B model only has 42 million
trainable LoRA parameters out of 8 billion parameters, which is
0.5196% of the model’s parameters.
In terms of quality, LoRA can also achieve comparable or sometimes
better results than full-fine-tuning. Multiple sets of LoRA weights can
be combined for different tasks or domains, allowing flexible
deployment and task switching without retraining. Different projects
are specialized in multiple-LoRA serving, such as LoRAX. It’s also a
feature supported by Hugging Face’s Text Generation Inference
(TGI) and Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIM).
QLoRA

## Page 387

Introduced by Dettmers et al., QLoRA is a method for fine-tuning
LLMs that addresses the challenges of high computational costs. By
combining quantization techniques with LoRA, QLoRA allows
developers to fine-tune models on relatively small, widely available
GPUs.
The core of QLoRA’s approach involves quantizing the base model
parameters to a custom 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) data type, which
significantly reduces memory usage. Like LoRA, instead of updating
all model parameters during fine-tuning, QLoRA introduces small,
trainable low-rank matrices (adapters) to specific layers of the model.
Only these adapters are updated during training, while the original
model weights remain unchanged. To further reduce memory usage,
QLoRA employs double quantization, which quantizes the
quantization constants themselves. Additionally, it uses paged
optimizers to manage memory spikes during training by leveraging
Nvidia’s unified memory feature.
QLoRA provides significant memory savings compared to LoRA,
reducing peak GPU memory usage by up to 75%. For example, for a
7B model, QLoRA reduces peak memory usage from 14 GB to 9.1
GB during initialization, a 35% reduction. During fine-tuning, the
memory savings increase to 40%, from 15.6 GB for LoRA to 9.3 GB
for QLoRA. However, this memory efficiency comes at the cost of
increased training time, with QLoRA being about 30% slower than

## Page 388

LoRA. In terms of model performance, QLoRA shows only minor
differences compared to LoRA.
In summary, QLoRA is particularly beneficial when memory
constraints are the primary concern, such as when working with very
large models or on hardware with limited GPU memory. However, if
training speed is crucial and sufficient memory is available, LoRA
might be the preferred choice.
The decision between QLoRA and LoRA should be based on the
specific requirements of the project, available hardware, and the
need to balance memory usage, training speed, and model
performance.
Training parameters
When fine-tuning LLMs, several hyperparameters guide the training
process and significantly impact the model’s convergence,
generalization, and overall effectiveness.
Learning rate and scheduler
The learning rate is the most important hyperparameter. It controls
how much the model’s parameters are updated during training. It
typically ranges from very small values like 1e-6 to larger values
like 1e-3 . A common starting point for transformer models is often

## Page 389

around 1e-5 . If the learning rate is too low, training progresses
slowly and may get stuck in suboptimal solutions. Conversely, if it’s
too high, training can become unstable or diverge, leading to poor
performance. It’s often beneficial to experiment with different learning
rates to find the optimal value for your specific task and model.
The learning rate scheduler adjusts the learning rate throughout the
training process. It typically starts with a higher learning rate to
enable rapid initial progress, then gradually decreases it in later
stages to fine-tune the model more precisely. The two most common
types of schedulers are linear and cosine. A linear scheduler
decreases the learning rate steadily over time, while a cosine
scheduler follows a cosine curve, decreasing more slowly at first and
then more rapidly toward the end of training. For example, you might
start with a learning rate of 3e-4 and decrease it to 1e-7 over the
course of training. The specific values and decay schedule depend
on your model and dataset, but a common approach is to use a
warmup period (e.g., 5% of total steps) where the learning rate
increases from 0 to the initial value, followed by a decay period for
the remaining 95% of steps. This approach helps stabilize early
training and allows for more refined updates as the model
converges. In general, linear and cosine schedulers provide the
same level of performance.

## Page 390

Batch size
The batch size determines the number of samples processed before
the model’s weights are updated. Typical batch sizes for LLM fine-
tuning range from 1 to 32, with common values being 1, 2, 4, 8, or
16. Larger batch sizes generally lead to more stable gradient
estimates and can improve training speed, as they provide a better
approximation of the true gradient of the entire dataset.
However, they also require more memory, which can be a limiting
factor on GPUs with less VRAM. For instance, a batch size of 16
might work well on a high-end GPU with 24GB of memory, while a
smaller GPU with 8 GB might only handle a batch size of 2 or 4.
To overcome memory constraints while still benefiting from larger
batch sizes, a technique called gradient accumulation can be used. It
works by performing multiple forward and backward passes with
smaller mini-batches, accumulating the gradients over these steps
before applying a single update to the model’s parameters. This
approach is particularly useful when working with large models or
limited GPU memory. For example, if you want to achieve an
effective batch size of 32 but your GPU can only handle 8 samples
at a time, you can set the gradient accumulation steps to 4. This
means you’ll process 4 mini-batches of 8 samples each,

## Page 391

accumulating the gradients, and then update the model as if you had
processed all 32 samples at once.
The number of gradient accumulation steps typically ranges from 1
(no accumulation) to 8 or 16, depending on the desired effective
batch size and available computational resources. When choosing
the number of steps, consider the trade-off between training speed
and memory usage. More accumulation steps allow for larger
effective batch sizes but increase the time required for each update.
Here’s a simple formula to determine the effective batch size:
For instance, if you’re using 2 GPUs, each processing a batch of 4
samples, with 4 gradient accumulation steps, your effective batch
size would be 4 * 2 * 4 = 32 samples.
Maximum length and packing
The maximum sequence length determines the longest input the
model can process. It’s typically set between 512 and 4,096 tokens
but can go up to 128,000 or more, depending on the task and
available GPU memory. For example, a maximum length of 2,048
tokens is common for many language generation tasks, while RAG
applications might use up to 8,192 tokens or more. When processing
input data, sequences longer than this limit are truncated, meaning

## Page 392

excess tokens are removed. Truncation can occur at the beginning
(left truncation) or end (right truncation) of the sequence. For
instance, with a maximum length of 1,024 tokens, a 1,500-token
input would have 476 tokens removed. This parameter directly
impacts batch size and memory usage; a batch size of 12 with a max
length of 1,024 would contain 12,288 tokens ( 12 * 1,024 ), while
the same batch size with a max length of 512 would only contain
6,144 tokens. It’s important to balance this parameter with your GPU
capabilities and the nature of your training data to optimize
performance and resource utilization.
Packing maximizes the utilization of each training batch. Instead of
assigning one sample per batch, packing combines multiple smaller
samples into a single batch, effectively increasing the amount of data
processed in each iteration. For example, if your maximum
sequence length is 1,024 tokens, but many of your samples are only
200-300 tokens long, packing could allow you to fit 3-4 samples into
each batch slot. This approach can significantly improve training
efficiency, especially when dealing with datasets containing many
short sequences. However, packing requires careful implementation
to ensure that model attention doesn’t cross between packed
samples. This is typically achieved by using attention masks that
prevent the model from attending to tokens from different samples
within the same packed sequence.

## Page 393

Number of epochs
The number of epochs is another important parameter, representing
the number of complete passes through the entire training dataset.
For LLM fine-tuning, the typical range is 1 to 10 epochs, with many
successful runs using 2 to 5 epochs. The optimal number depends
on factors such as task complexity, dataset size, and model
architecture. More epochs allow the model to refine its learning,
potentially improving performance. However, there’s a crucial trade-
off: too few epochs may lead to underfitting, while too many can
cause overfitting. For example, a large model fine-tuned on a small
dataset might only need 1-3 epochs, while a smaller model fine-
tuned on a larger dataset could benefit from 5-10 epochs. It is helpful
to monitor validation performance during training and implement
early stopping if the model’s performance plateaus or degrades. This
approach helps determine the optimal number of epochs dynamically
and prevents overfitting.
Optimizers
Optimizers adjust the model’s parameters to minimize the loss
function. For LLM fine-tuning, AdamW (Adaptive Moment Estimation
with Weight Decay) is highly recommended, particularly its 8-bit
version. AdamW 8-bit performs comparably to the 32-bit version
while using less GPU memory (but it doesn’t improve training

## Page 394

speed). AdamW combines adaptive learning rates with weight decay
regularization, often leading to better training stability and model
performance.
For scenarios with severe memory constraints, AdaFactor presents
an alternative designed for memory efficiency. It works well without
explicit learning rate tuning, making it particularly useful in resource-
constrained environments. However, it may not always match
AdamW’s performance in all cases. In situations involving extremely
large models or limited GPU memory, paged versions of optimizers,
such as paged AdamW 8-bit, can further reduce memory
consumption by offloading to CPU RAM. If memory allows and
maximum performance is the priority, the non-quantized
adamw_torch optimizer may be the best choice.
Weight decay
Weight decay works by adding a penalty for large weights to the loss
function, encouraging the model to learn simpler, more generalizable
features. This helps the model avoid relying too heavily on any single
input feature, which can improve its performance on unseen data.
Typically, weight decay values range from 0.01 to 0.1, with 0.01
being a common starting point. For example, if you’re using the
AdamW optimizer, you might set the weight decay to 0.01.

## Page 395

While weight decay can be beneficial, setting it too high can impede
learning by making it difficult for the model to capture important
patterns in the data. Conversely, setting it too low may not provide
sufficient regularization. The optimal weight decay value often
depends on the specific model architecture and dataset, so it’s
generally a good practice to experiment with different values.
Gradient checkpointing
Gradient checkpointing is a technique that reduces memory
consumption during training by storing only a subset of intermediate
activations generated in the forward pass. In standard training
procedures, all intermediate activations are retained in memory to
facilitate gradient calculation during the backward pass. However, for
very deep networks like LLMs, this approach can quickly become
impractical due to hardware limitations, especially on GPUs with
limited memory capacity.
Gradient checkpointing addresses this challenge by selectively
saving activations at specific layers within the network. For layers
where activations are not saved, they are recomputed during the
backward pass as needed for gradient computation. This approach
creates a trade-off between computation time and memory usage.
While it significantly reduces memory requirements, it may increase

## Page 396

overall computation time due to the need to recalculate some
activations.
Other parameters and techniques exist but play a minor role
compared to those previously discussed. In the next section, we will
explore how to select and tune these parameters using a concrete
example.
Fine-tuning in practice
Let’s now fine-tune an open-source model on our custom dataset. In
this section, we will show an example that implements LoRA and
QLoRA for efficiency. Depending on the hardware you have
available, you can select the technique that best corresponds to your
configuration.
There are many efficient open-weight models we can leverage for
task or domain-specific use cases. To select the most relevant LLM,
we need to consider three main parameters:
License: Some model licenses only allow non-commercial work,
which is a problem if we want to fine-tune for a company. Custom
licenses are common in this field, and can target companies with
a certain number of users, for example.
Budget: Models with smaller parameter sizes (<10 B) are a lot
cheaper to fine-tune and deploy for inference than larger models.

## Page 397

This is due to the fact that they can be run on cheaper GPUs and
process more tokens per second.
Performance: Evaluating the base model on general-purpose
benchmarks or, even better, domain- or task-specific benchmarks
relevant to the final use case, is crucial. This helps ensure that the
model has the necessary capabilities to perform well on the
intended tasks after fine-tuning.
In this chapter, we will choose Llama 3.1 8B, an open-weight model
released by Meta. It has a permissive custom license (“Llama 3.1
Community License Agreement”) that allows commercial use. With
8B parameters, it is small enough to fit on most GPUs while reaching
a high level of performance compared to its competitors. We can
verify this using the Open LLM Leaderboard, as well as other
benchmarks detailed in the model card.
There are specialized tools and libraries to fine-tune models. In
particular, we recommend the following:
TRL: This is a library created and maintained by Hugging Face to
train LLMs using SFT and preference alignment. It is a popular
and reliable library that tends to be the most up-to-date in terms of
algorithms. It works in single and multi-GPU settings with FSDP
and DeepSpeed.

## Page 398

Axolotl: Created by Wing Lian, this tool streamlines the fine-
tuning of LLMs with reusable YAML configuration files. It is based
on TRL but includes many additional features, such as
automatically combining datasets stored in various formats. It also
supports single- and multi-GPU settings with FSDP and
DeepSpeed.
Unsloth: Created by Daniel and Michael Han, Unsloth uses
custom kernels to speed up training (2-5x) and reduce memory
use (up to 80% less memory). It is based on TRL and provides
many utilities, such as automatically converting models into the
GGUF quantization format. At the time of writing, it is only
available for single-GPU settings.
To maximize efficiency, we will perform fine-tuning using the Unsloth
library. The following code is designed as part of our LLMOps
pipeline, but can also be used as a stand-alone script. It can also be
executed in different environments, like SageMaker, cloud GPUs
(like Lambda Labs or RunPod), Google Colab, and many others. We
tested it on different GPUs, like A40, A100, and L4.
To install the Unsloth library and its dependencies, we recommend
directly installing from the GitHub repository of the book
(https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineering) or
Unsloth’s repo (https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth). This

## Page 399

approach is recommended because the installation steps are
regularly updated to address potential conflicts with dependencies:
1. First, we want to access a gated model and (optionally) upload
our fine-tuned model to Hugging Face
(https://huggingface.co/). This requires being logged in to an
account. If you don’t have an account, you can create it and store
your API key (Settings | Access Tokens | Create new token) in
the .env file:
HF_TOKEN = YOUR_API_KEY
2. Make sure that your Comet ML API key is also in the .env file:
COMET_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
3. Import all the necessary packages:
import os
import torch
from trl import SFTTrainer
from datasets import load_dataset, concatenate_d
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Text

## Page 400

4. Let’s now load the model to fine-tune and its corresponding
tokenizer. We use Unsloth’s FastLaguageModel class with the
.from_pretrained() method. In addition to the model name,
we need to specify the max sequence length (2,048 in this
example). Finally, the load_in_4bit argument indicates if we
want to use QLoRA (quantized pre-trained weights) or LoRA.
We’ll use LoRA in this example because of faster training and higher
quality, but you can easily switch to QLoRA if you don’t meet the
VRAM requirements.
max_seq_length = 2048
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrain
model_name="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B",
max_seq_length=max_seq_length,
load_in_4bit=False,
)
5. Now that the model is loaded, we can define our LoRA
configuration. Here, we use a rank of 32 that is large enough to
imitate the writing style and copy the knowledge from our
instruction samples. You can increase this value to 64 or 128 if
your results are underwhelming. We also set an alpha of 32,
without dropout and without bias, to speed up training. Finally, we

## Page 401

target every linear layer to maximize the quality of the fine-tuning
process.
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
model,
r=32,
lora_alpha=32,
lora_dropout=0,
target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj"
)
6. Next, we need to prepare the data in the right format for fine-
tuning. In this example, we don’t have a lot of samples in the
llmtwin dataset (3,000 samples). This is an issue because the
model might not correctly learn the chat template. To address this,
we will upsample it with a high-quality general-purpose dataset
called FineTome. This is a filtered version of arcee-ai/The-Tome
using the fineweb-edu-classifier . Instead of using the
100,000 samples of this dataset, we will specify we only want
10,000 in the train split. We concatenate these two datasets to
create our final set.
dataset1 = load_dataset("mlabonne/llmtwin")
dataset2 = load_dataset("mlabonne/FineTome-Alpac
dataset = concatenate datasets([dataset1 datase

## Page 402

dataset = concatenate_datasets([dataset1, datase
7. Now, we need to format this data using a chat template. Let’s use
the Alpaca template for convenience. This template doesn’t
require additional tokens, which makes it less error-prone (but can
slightly impact performance compared to ChatML). Here, we map
all the instructions and answers to the Alpaca template. We
manually add the end of sentence (EOS) token at the end of
each message to ensure that the model learns to output it.
Without it, it will keep generating answers without ever stopping.
alpaca_template = """Below is an instruction tha
### Instruction:
{}
### Response:
{}"""
EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token
dataset = dataset.map(format_samples, batched=Tr
8. Once the dataset is ready, we can divide it into training (95%) and
test (5%) sets for validation during training.
dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.0

## Page 403

9. The model is now ready to be trained. The SFTTrainer() class
stores all the hyperparameters for our training. In addition, we
provide the model, tokenizer, LoRA configuration, and datasets.
Following the recommendations from the previous section, we set
a learning rate of 3e-4 with a linear scheduler and a maximum
sequence length of 2048. We train this model for three epochs
with a batch size of 2 and 8 gradient accumulation steps (for an
effective batch size of 16). We also choose the adamw_8bit
optimizer with a weight_decay of 0.01. Depending on the GPU
we use, it will automatically use FP16 or BF16 for the activations.
Finally, we report our training run to Comet ML for experiment
tracking.
trainer = SFTTrainer(
model=model,
tokenizer=tokenizer,
train_dataset=dataset["train"],
eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
dataset_text_field="text",
max_seq_length=max_seq_length,
dataset_num_proc=2,
packing=True,
args=TrainingArguments(
learning_rate=3e-4,
lr_scheduler_type="linear",
per_device_train_batch_size=2,

## Page 404

gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
num_train_epochs=3,
fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),
bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),
logging_steps=1,
optim="adamw_8bit",
weight_decay=0.01,
warmup_steps=10,
output_dir="output",
report_to="comet_ml",
seed=0,
),
)
trainer.train()
Training this model on our concatenated dataset can take a few
hours. For example, it takes 50 minutes on an A100 GPU.
10. Once it’s done, we can test it with a quick example. The goal is
not to properly evaluate the fine-tuned model, but to make sure
that there are no obvious errors related to the tokenizer or chat
template.
For fast inference, we can use
FastLanguageModel.for_inference() from Unsloth. We directly
format an instruction with the Alpaca format. Note that we provide an
empty answer to append the assistant header ( ### Response ): at

## Page 405

the end of the user instruction. This forces the model to answer the
instruction instead of completing it. We also use a text streamer to
stream the generation instead of waiting for it to be complete before
printing it.
FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)
message = alpaca_prompt.format("Write a paragraph
inputs = tokenizer([message], return_tensors="pt")
text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)
_ = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=text_streame
11. Here is the answer provided by our model:
Supervised fine-tuning is a method used to enhan
responses with human expectations, thereby impro
This is correct and properly formatted with the Alpaca chat template.
12. Now that our model has been successfully fine-tuned, we can
save it locally and/or push it to the Hugging Face Hub using the
following functions.
model.save_pretrained_merged("model", tokenizer,
model.push_to_hub_merged("mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1

## Page 406

Congratulations on fine-tuning a base model from scratch! During
training, you can access Comet ML to monitor your training loss,
validation loss, and many other metrics. You want to make sure that
these metrics correspond to what is expected. Figure 5.11 shows the
training run corresponding to the previous code in Comet ML.
Figure 5.11 – Four monitored metrics during fine-tuning in Comet ML
In particular, three of these metrics are important to monitor:

## Page 407

Training loss: It measures how well the model is performing on
the task it’s being trained for. The loss should continuously
decrease on average, indicating improving performance. We
expect a rapid decrease at the beginning of training, followed by a
long plateau. Spikes and continuous increases in the loss value
are signs that the training is failing. In this case, you might want to
check the quality of your data, issues with the tokenizer, and tune
parameters like learning rate and batch size. In Figure 5.11 (loss),
you can see three different phases corresponding to our three
epochs.
Validation loss: It measures the loss using the validation set
instead of the training set; a well-fitted model typically shows both
training and validation losses decreasing and eventually
stabilizing, with a small gap between them. This gap should be
minimal but is expected to exist as the model will always perform
slightly better on the training data. If the training loss continues to
decrease while the validation loss starts to increase, it’s a sign of
overfitting. Conversely, if both curves remain flat at a relatively
high loss value, it indicates underfitting. There are no universal
“recommended ranges” for loss values, as these depend on the
specific problem and loss function used. However, you should
look for convergence and stability in both curves. In Figure 4.11
(eval_loss), we see a slight increase at step 340. This is still
acceptable but might indicate that the model starts to overfit.

## Page 408

Gradient norm: It represents the magnitude of the gradient vector
during training. Large gradient norms can indicate training
instability like overfitting, especially if accompanied by a
divergence between training and validation losses. On the other
hand, a stable or decreasing gradient norm generally means that
the model is converging toward a local optimum. To mitigate
issues associated with large gradient norms, gradient clipping can
be employed. This technique involves setting a maximum
threshold for the gradient norm, effectively limiting the size of
parameter updates.
It is often interesting to try different learning rates and select the best
model based on the minimal loss. Note that this is a proxy for real
evaluations, which are covered in the next chapter.
Summary
This chapter covered essential aspects of LLM fine-tuning, both in
theory and practice. We examined the instruction data pipeline and
how to create high-quality datasets, from curation to augmentation.
Each pipeline stage offers optimization opportunities, particularly in
quality assessment, data generation, and enhancement. This flexible
pipeline can be adapted to your use cases by selecting the most
relevant stages and techniques.

## Page 409

We applied this framework to real-world data from Chapter 3, using
an LLM to convert raw text into instruction-answer pairs. We then
explored SFT techniques. This included an analysis of SFT’s
advantages and limitations, methods for storing and parsing
instruction datasets with chat templates, and an overview of three
primary SFT techniques: full fine-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA. We
compared these methods based on their impact on memory usage,
training efficiency, and output quality. The chapter concluded with a
practical demonstration that involved fine-tuning a Llama 3.1 8 B
model on our custom instruction dataset. This example highlighted
key steps and implementation details for successful fine-tuning.
In the next chapter, we will use preference alignment techniques to
create a new version of TwinLlama-3.1-8B. We will generate a new
dataset with chosen and rejected answers that will help us calibrate
the type of answers we expect from our model. We will detail many
applications that can benefit from this framework and how to
implement it.

Fine-Tuning with Preference
Alignment
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has been crucial in adapting LLMs
to perform specific tasks. However, SFT struggles to capture the
nuances of human preferences and the long tail of potential
interactions that a model might encounter. This limitation has led to
the development of more advanced techniques for aligning AI
systems with human preferences, grouped under the umbrella term
preference alignment.
Preference alignment addresses the shortcomings of SFT by
incorporating direct human or AI feedback into the training process.
This method allows a more nuanced understanding of human
preferences, especially in complex scenarios where simple
supervised learning falls short. While numerous techniques exist for
preference alignment, this chapter will primarily focus on Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for simplicity and efficiency.
In this chapter, we will talk about the type of data that is required by
preference alignment algorithms like DPO. We will build our own
dataset to modify the writing style of our model, making it less

## Page 413

artificial and more authentic. We will introduce the DPO algorithm
and implement it to align the model trained in Chapter 5.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
Understanding preference datasets
How to create our own preference dataset
Direct preference optimization (DPO)
Implementing DPO in practice to align our model
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create your own
preference datasets and align models with diverse techniques.
All the code examples from this chapter can be found
on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering.
Understanding preference datasets
The principles for creating high-quality preference datasets are the
same as those discussed in Chapter 5 for instruction datasets. We
want to maximize the accuracy, diversity, and complexity of our
samples. To achieve this, we follow the same stages, as outlined in
Figure 6.1: data curation, deduplication, decontamination, quality
evaluation, exploration, generation, and augmentation.

## Page 414

Figure 6.1 – Overview of the post-training data pipeline covered in
this chapter
To avoid repetition, this section will focus on the main differences
between instruction and preference datasets. We will introduce the
structure of preference samples and the ideal size for preference
datasets. Then, we will focus on the two stages that differ most from
creating instruction datasets: data generation and evaluation.
Preference data
Preference datasets lack the standardization of instruction datasets
due to varying data requirements across different training algorithms.
Preference data comprises a collection of responses to a given
instruction, ranked by humans or language models. This chapter
focuses on DPO, so we will examine the specific data format
required by this algorithm.

## Page 415

As illustrated in Table 6.1, the structure of DPO datasets is
straightforward: each instruction is paired with one preferred answer
and one rejected answer. The objective is to train the model to
generate the preferred response rather than the rejected one.
Instruction
Tell me a joke about octopuses.
Chosen answer Rejected answer
Why don’t octopuses play cards How many tickles does it
in casinos? Because they can’t take to make an octopus
count past eight. laugh? Ten tickles.
Table 6.1 – Example of sample from the mlabonne/orpo-dpo-mix-40k
dataset
In preference datasets, the rejected response is as important as the
chosen one. Without the rejected response, the dataset would be a
simple instruction set. Rejected responses represent the behavior
we aim to eliminate from the model. This provides a lot of flexibility
and allows us to use preference datasets in many contexts. Here is a
list of examples where preference datasets are more beneficial to
use compared to using SFT alone:

## Page 416

Chatbots: In conversational AI, the quality of responses often
depends on subjective factors like naturalness, engagement, and
contextual appropriateness. A preference dataset allows the
model to learn these nuanced aspects by comparing better and
worse responses. Simple SFT might not capture the subtleties of
what makes one response preferable over another in a given
context.
Content moderation: Determining whether content is appropriate
or violates guidelines often involves nuanced judgments.
Preference datasets can help the model learn to distinguish
between borderline cases by comparing examples of content that
is and isn’t acceptable. This is more effective than binary
classification through SFT, as it helps the model understand the
reasoning behind moderation decisions.
Summarization: The quality of a summary often depends on
factors like conciseness, relevance, and coherence. By using
preference datasets, models can learn to generate summaries
that humans find more useful and informative. Simple SFT might
result in summaries that are technically correct but less preferable
to human readers.
Code generation: In coding tasks, there are often multiple correct
solutions, but some are more efficient or readable, or follow better
practices than others. Preference datasets can help the model

## Page 417

learn these qualitative aspects of code quality, which might not be
captured by simple correctness-based SFT.
Creative writing: For tasks like story generation or poetry writing,
the quality of the output is highly subjective and multifaceted.
Preference datasets can capture human judgments about style,
creativity, and emotional impact better than instruction datasets,
which might focus more on technical correctness or adherence to
prompts.
Translation: While traditional metrics like BLEU scores can
measure translation accuracy, they don’t always capture the
fluency or naturalness of the translation. Preference datasets can
help models learn to produce translations that native speakers
prefer, even when multiple translations are technically correct.
In all these scenarios, preference datasets enable a more refined
training approach. They capture subjective quality assessments and
human preferences that extend beyond simple correctness or
adherence to instructions. This method can produce models that
generate output that is not only technically accurate but also better
aligned with human judgment and preferences in complex, open-
ended tasks.
Unlike instruction datasets, there are no standardized storage
formats like Alpaca or ShareGPT. Most preference datasets follow a
structure similar to that shown in Table 6.1, with columns for an

## Page 418

instruction, a preferred answer, and a rejected answer. Multi-turn
conversations are uncommon in preference alignment. At the time of
writing, major fine-tuning libraries do not support multi-turn
conversations and typically extract only the first or last message in a
conversation.
Data quantity
DPO datasets typically require fewer samples than instruction
datasets to significantly impact model behavior. As with instruction
datasets, the required sample count depends on model size and task
complexity. Larger models are more sample-efficient and thus
require less data, while complex tasks demand more examples to
capture the desired behavior. Once again, data quality is crucial, and
a large number of preference pairs is generally beneficial.
General-purpose alignment is used by LLM providers to improve the
overall performance of the fine-tuned models. This requires
preference datasets with millions of samples. Major players in the AI
industry, including Nvidia and Meta, are converging on similar post-
training pipelines, involving multiple rounds of preference alignment,
and extensive use of synthetic data. This consensus suggests that
these methods are proving to be the most effective for pushing the
boundaries of language model capabilities.

## Page 419

On a smaller scale, the open-source community uses datasets
ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 samples to enhance model
performance. This approach has proven effective not only in
improving benchmark scores but also in healing networks after
merging, pruning, and other modifications. Generally, DPO is less
destructive than SFT and has a milder impact on the final model.
On the other hand, tasks like the ones previously described require
fewer preference pairs. Task-specific alignment focuses on
improving model performance for a particular function, such as
modifying the writing style, refusing certain instructions, and so on.
These alignments can often be achieved with smaller datasets,
ranging from 100 to 10,000 preference pairs, depending on the
task’s complexity.
An example of an application that requires few samples is instructing
the model to state that it wasn’t trained by OpenAI, Meta, or another
LLM provider. This can be achieved using a preference dataset,
where the rejected answers are those claiming alternative origins,
and the chosen answers are responses where the model correctly
states that it was trained by you. A relatively small dataset of 200 to
500 pairs can be enough for this task.
Data generation and evaluation

## Page 420

When creating preference datasets, data generation and evaluation
are closely linked. We first create answers and then rate them to
make the final dataset. In the following, we introduce both steps as
one process instead of two separate ones.
Generating preferences
Before making new preference data, it’s good to look at relevant
open-source datasets. There are fewer of these compared to
instruction datasets, but you can find high-quality preference
datasets on the Hugging Face Hub. These can be used for specific
tasks or to add to your own dataset. Well-known preference datasets
include the Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset, which has human
preferences for helpful and harmless AI responses, and the OpenAI
Summarize from Human Feedback dataset, which focuses on article
summaries.
DPO datasets can be created using various methods, each with its
own trade-offs between quality, cost, and scalability. These methods
can be tailored to specific applications and require varying degrees
of human feedback. We divide them into four main categories:
Human-generated, human-evaluated datasets: This method
involves hiring people to both create responses to prompts and
evaluate the quality of these responses. While this approach can
capture nuanced human preferences and is ideal for complex

## Page 421

tasks, it’s extremely resource-intensive and difficult to scale. As a
result, it’s primarily used by large AI companies with substantial
resources.
Human-generated, LLM-evaluated datasets: This method can
be useful if you have a lot of existing human-generated content.
However, it’s rarely used in practice due to inefficiency, as it still
requires significant human input for response generation while
potentially missing nuanced preferences during the LLM
evaluation stage.
LLM-generated, human-evaluated datasets: This method offers
a good balance between quality and efficiency. LLMs generate
multiple responses to prompts, and humans rank these
responses. This approach is often preferred because humans are
generally better at judging answers than writing them from
scratch. It allows the rapid generation of diverse responses while
still capturing human preferences effectively. However, it may not
provide creative or unexpected responses that humans might
generate.
LLM-generated, LLM-evaluated datasets: Fully synthetic
datasets, where both generation and evaluation are done by
LLMs, are becoming increasingly common due to their scalability
and cost-effectiveness. This method can produce massive
datasets quickly and improves as LLM capabilities advance.
However, it requires careful prompt engineering to ensure quality

## Page 422

and diversity, and may perpetuate biases or limitations of the
generating LLM.
In practice, human-generated datasets are expensive, difficult to
scale, and not necessarily of the highest quality. On the other hand,
human evaluation is quite valuable but can be difficult to scale, which
is why large datasets benefit from LLM evaluation. In addition to
these high-level considerations, the way you obtain your data and
how you plan to use it also need to be considered. For example,
applications with many users can embed a feedback mechanism to
provide preferences. This can be as simple as a like and
dislike score, or something more in-depth with text.
Note that evaluation is not always required and preferences can
emerge naturally from the generation process. For instance, it is
possible to use a high-quality model to generate preferred outputs
and a lower-quality or intentionally flawed model to produce less
preferred alternatives. This creates a clear distinction in the
preference dataset, allowing more effective training of AI systems to
recognize and emulate high-quality outputs. The
Intel/orca_dpo_pairs dataset available on the Hugging Face
Hub was created with this process.
Another approach is to compare model-generated outputs with
human-written responses, which can provide insights into how well

## Page 423

the model aligns with actual human preferences and highlight areas
where the model may be lacking. This can be used to copy a
particular style and give a more authentic tone to the model.
Tips for data generation
The data generation is consistent between instruction and
preference datasets. Prompts should be designed to encourage
diversity and complexity in the model’s responses. By crafting
prompts that explicitly request different approaches or styles, we can
ensure a wide range of outputs that capture the varied nature of
human preferences.
For instance, when generating summaries, one might request
variations such as concise summaries, detailed summaries, and
summaries focusing on key points. This approach not only produces
a diverse dataset but also helps in understanding how different
styles and approaches align with human preferences.
Introducing variability in the outputs is another crucial aspect of
generating synthetic preference datasets. This can be achieved by
manipulating the temperature settings or employing other sampling
methods in the LLM. Higher temperature settings tend to produce
more creative and diverse responses, while lower settings result in
more focused and deterministic outputs. This creates a trade-off
between diversity and coherence, which depends on the kind of data

## Page 424

we want to generate. For example, generating code requires low
creativity, thus low temperature, while writing articles can be high
temperature.
Using multiple LLMs to generate samples can be better than using
just one model. Some LLMs are better at specific tasks, and this
approach also adds more variety. This approach is used by popular
open-source datasets like argilla/Capybara-Preferences ,
combining GPT-4 with open-weight models. The evaluation process
then selects the chosen and the rejected answers.
Evaluating preferences
Data evaluation can be performed by human raters or automated
with LLMs. LLM evaluation involves developing detailed criteria,
creating a prompt that clearly communicates these guidelines to the
LLM, and using the model to select preferred and rejected
responses. While more scalable than human rating and allowing the
consistent application of criteria, this quality of LLM evaluation
depends directly on the model’s performance and the provided
guidelines. It may miss subtle human preferences or cultural
nuances. However, as LLMs continue to improve, their ability to
make nuanced judgments improves as well, potentially leading to
higher-quality datasets over time.

## Page 425

Implementing LLM evaluation for preference datasets can be done
through absolute scoring or pairwise ranking. In absolute scoring, the
LLM assigns a numerical score or categorical rating to each
response based on predefined criteria. This method is
straightforward but may suffer from inconsistency across different
prompts or evaluation sessions. Pairwise ranking, on the other hand,
involves presenting the LLM with two responses and asking it to
choose the better one or rank them. This approach more closely
mimics the format of human evaluation and can lead to more
consistent results.
For absolute scoring, you would create a prompt that outlines the
evaluation criteria and asks the LLM to rate the response on a
specific scale (e.g., 1-5 or poor/fair/good/excellent). The prompt
might look like this: “Rate the following response on a scale of 1-5
based on relevance, coherence, and helpfulness: [ INSERT
RESPONSE ].” For pairwise ranking, the prompt could be: “Compare
the following two responses. Which one is better in terms of
relevance, coherence, and helpfulness? Response A: [ INSERT
RESPONSE A ] Response B: [ INSERT RESPONSE B ].”
The comparative nature of preference datasets makes pairwise
ranking an ideal approach for evaluation. This method is generally
more accurate and more closely correlated to human judgment than
absolute scoring. Pairwise ranking mimics the natural way humans

## Page 426

compare options, making it easier for both human raters and LLMs
to provide consistent and meaningful evaluations.
We can further improve the accuracy of pairwise ranking by
providing a ground-truth answer and using chain-of-thought
reasoning. This approach encourages the evaluating LLM to
consider multiple aspects of the responses and articulate its
decision-making process, leading to more thorough and justified
evaluations. When no ground-truth answer is available, we can
prompt the LLM to create a grading note, which is a description of
the expected answer. This technique works particularly well in
scenarios where the LLM doesn’t have extensive knowledge about a
given topic, as it forces the model to establish clear criteria for
evaluation before assessing the responses.
Here’s a concrete implementation of an LLM-as-a-judge prompt to
perform pairwise ranking:
Instruction
You are an answer judge. Your goal is to compare answer A and
answer B. I want to know which answer does a better job of
answering the instruction in terms of relevance, accuracy,
completeness, clarity, structure, and conciseness.
Instruction: {instruction}
Answer A: {answer_a}

## Page 427

Answer B: {answer_b}
Explain your reasoning step by step and output the letter of the
best answer using the following structure:
Reasoning: (compare the two answers)
Best answer: (A or B)
Table 6.2 – Example of LLM-as-a-judge prompt for pairwise ranking
with one instruction and two answers
However, it’s important to note that LLM-based evaluation can be
subject to several types of bias:
Position bias: In relative scoring, LLM judges tend to favor the
first answer presented. This bias can skew results and lead to
inaccurate preferences.
Length bias: Similar to humans, LLM judges often show a
preference for longer answers, potentially overlooking the quality
of shorter, more concise responses.
Family bias: LLM judges may favor responses that are generated
by themselves or models from the same family, potentially due to
similarities in language patterns or knowledge bases.
To mitigate these biases and enhance the quality of preference
datasets, several solutions can be implemented. One key approach
is to randomize the order of answer A and answer B in each

## Page 428

comparison, which can counteract position bias by ensuring that the
order of presentation doesn’t consistently influence the evaluation.
Another valuable strategy involves providing few-shot examples that
demonstrate a balanced distribution of scores. These examples
serve to calibrate the judge LLM’s internal scoring mechanism and
can effectively address both length and family bias by illustrating that
shorter answers or those from different model families can also be of
high quality. Additionally, employing multiple models as a jury, rather
than relying on a single LLM judge, can significantly improve the
robustness of the evaluation process. This multi-model approach
helps to balance out individual biases that may be present in any
single model, leading to a more comprehensive and accurate
assessment of the responses.
In the next section, we will create our own preference dataset. We
will rely on the data generation process to naturally create chosen
(human-generated) and rejected (LLM-generated) answers.
Creating our own preference dataset
Our model can currently write paragraphs about topics related to
machine learning, but it doesn’t have the same writing style as the
original authors. This is a typical use case for preference alignment,
where we want to change the “voice” of the model to closely imitate
the source data. It’s important to note that, experimentally, DPO

## Page 429

tends to make models more verbose and pushes them to use very
formal language. Therefore, the training will need to use DPO
surgically to avoid this pitfall and instead adopt the less formal style
of these blog articles.
In this section, we will create a preference dataset where the chosen
answers are extracts from the text, while rejected answers are
generated by the model. To implement it, we will modify the code
created in Chapter 5, which was designed to generate instruction
datasets.
As seen in the previous section, preference and instruction datasets
rely on the same principles. Instead of pairs of instructions and
answers, we need triples (instruction, answer 1, answer 2). What’s
interesting in this setting is that we have ground-truth answers in the
text chunks, which means we don’t need complex evaluation
processes like LLM judges. To make sure that these extracts are
high-quality, we will implement two additional quality filters, based on
length and punctuation. Figure 6.2 summarizes the end-to-end

Figure 6.2 – Synthetic data generation pipeline from raw text to
preference dataset
We are now ready to implement the preference data generation
pipeline:
1. We start by importing the necessary libraries.
import concurrent.futures
import json
import re
from typing import List, Tuple
from datasets import Dataset
from openai import OpenAI
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

## Page 431

2. Instead of the InstructionAnswerSet class, we now have a
PreferenceSet class. This class is designed to handle triples of
instructions, generated answers (rejected), and extracted answers
(chosen).
class PreferenceSet:
def __init__(self, triples: List[Tuple[str,
self.triples = triples
@classmethod
def from_json(cls, json_str: str) -> 'Prefer
data = json.loads(json_str)
triples = [(triple['instruction'], tripl
for triple in data['preferenc
return cls(triples)
def __iter__(self):
return iter(self.triples)
3. The load_articles_from_json , clean_text , and
extract_substrings functions remain unchanged from the
original code. Let’s start with load_articles_from_json , which
takes our JSON file ( cleaned_documents.json ) containing the
articles as input and returns a Hugging Face dataset with the text
and metadata (ID, platform, author ID, author full name, link).

## Page 432

def load_articles_from_json(file_path: str) -> D
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
data = json.load(file)
return Dataset.from_dict(
{
"id": [item["id"] for item in data["
"content": [item["content"] for item
"platform": [item["platform"] for it
"author_id": [item["author_id"] for
"author_full_name": [item["author_fu
"link": [item["link"] for item in da
}
)
4. The clean_text function removes non-alphanumeric characters
except for apostrophes, periods, commas, exclamation marks,
and question marks. It also replaces multiple whitespaces with a
single space to ensure proper formatting.
def clean_text(text: str) -> str: text = re.s
return text.strip()
5. The extract_substrings function splits articles into chunks
with a length between 1,000 and 2,000 characters. To make sure
that the splitting doesn’t break sentences, which could modify

## Page 433

their meanings, we use a regex to only split after the end of a
sentence.
def extract_substrings(dataset: Dataset, min_len
extracts = []
sentence_pattern = r"(?<!\w\.\w.)(?<![A-Z][a
for article in dataset["content"]:
cleaned_article = clean_text(article)
sentences = re.split(sentence_pattern, c
current_chunk = ""
for sentence in sentences:
sentence = sentence.strip()
if not sentence:
continue
if len(current_chunk) + len(sentence
current_chunk += sentence + " "
else:
if len(current_chunk) >= min_len
extracts.append(current_chun
current_chunk = sentence + " "
if len(current_chunk) >= min_length:
extracts.append(current_chunk.strip(
return extracts
6. The generate_preference_triples function replaces the
original generate_instruction_answer_pairs function. The

## Page 434

prompt is adapted from the instruction version and is designed to
generate triples instead of pairs. It also provides general guidance
about the type of instructions we’re interested in, how to extract
answers from articles, and how to style them:
def generate_preference_triples(extract: str, cl
prompt = f"""Based on the following extract,
1. An instruction asking about a specific topic
2. A generated answer that attempts to answer th

{{
"instruction": "...",
"generated_answer": "...",
"extracted_answer": "..."
}},
...
]
}}
Extract:
{extract}

## Page 435

{extract}
"""
7. In the same function, we use GPT-4o-mini to generate our
answers using JSON mode. We specify in the system prompt that
we want triples instead of pairs. The JSON answers are directly
parsed by our PreferenceSet class to return the expected list of
tuples.
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o-mini",
messages=[
{
"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful as
},
{"role": "user", "content": prompt},
],
response_format={"type": "json_object"},
max_tokens=2000,
temperature=0.7,
)
result = PreferenceSet.from_json(completion
return result.triples

## Page 436

8. Two new filtering functions are introduced for the preference data
pipeline: filter_short_answers and
filter_answer_format . These functions filter out short
answers and ensure that answers start with an uppercase letter
and end with proper punctuation. We use them as heuristics to
filter out samples with poor quality.
def filter_short_answers(dataset: Dataset, min_l
def is_long_enough(example):
return len(example['chosen']) >= min_len
return dataset.filter(is_long_enough)
def filter_answer_format(dataset: Dataset) -> Da
def is_valid_format(example):
chosen = example['chosen']
return (len(chosen) > 0 and
chosen[0].isupper() and
chosen[-1] in ('.', '!', '?'))
return dataset.filter(is_valid_format)
9. The create_preference_dataset function replaces the original
create_instruction_dataset function. This function now
works with triples instead of pairs and uses different column
names in the resulting dataset.

## Page 437

def create_preference_dataset(dataset: Dataset,
extracts = extract_substrings(dataset)
preference_triples = []
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(m
futures = [
executor.submit(generate_preference_
for extract in extracts
]
for future in tqdm(concurrent.futures.as
preference_triples.extend(future.res
instructions, generated_answers, extracted_a
return Dataset.from_dict(
{
"prompt": list(instructions),
"rejected": list(generated_answers),
"chosen": list(extracted_answers)
}
)
10. The main function is updated to include the new filtering steps and
to use the preference dataset creation function:
def main(dataset_id: str) -> Dataset:
client = OpenAI()
# 1. Load the raw data
raw_dataset = load_articles_from_json("clean
print("Raw dataset:")

## Page 438

print( Raw dataset: )
print(raw_dataset.to_pandas())
# 2. Create preference dataset
dataset = create_preference_dataset(raw_data
print("Preference dataset:")
print(dataset.to_pandas())
# 3. Filter out samples with short answers
dataset = filter_short_answers(dataset)
# 4. Filter answers based on format
dataset = filter_answer_format(dataset)
# 5. Export
dataset.push_to_hub(dataset_id)
return dataset
The create_preference_dataset() function generated 2,970
samples. This dataset is then heavily filtered to only retain 1,467
samples by removing answers that are too short or not properly
formatted (for example, answers that start with an uppercase letter
or end with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark).
The final dataset is available on the Hugging Face Hub at the
following address:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/llmtwin-dpo.
You can see in Figure 6.3 an example that captures a subtle nuance
in terms of writing style. Both answers are correct, but the chosen
(extracted) answer sounds slightly more casual.

## Page 439

Figure 6.3 – Screenshot of the mlabonne/llmtwin-dpo preference
dataset on the Hugging Face Hub
To produce this dataset, we iterated many times over the prompt to
generate the data. This required some manual evaluation and
experiments until we reached satisfying results. The quality of the
prompt is fundamental in this process, which is why it is
recommended to follow a similar process to generate your own
preference datasets.
In the next section, we will introduce concepts related to
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and
DPO. This will cover new parameters and ideas that are
implemented in the final section of this chapter.
Preference alignment
Preference alignment regroups techniques to fine-tune models on
preference data. In this section, we provide an overview of this field

## Page 440

and then focus on the technique we will implement: Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO).
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
combines reinforcement learning (RL) with human input to align
models with human preferences and values. RLHF emerged as a
response to challenges in traditional RL methods, particularly the
difficulty of specifying reward functions for complex tasks and the
potential for misalignment between engineered rewards and
intended objectives.
The origins of RLHF can be traced back to the field of preference-
based reinforcement learning (PbRL), which was independently
introduced by Akrour et al. and Cheng et al. in 2011. PbRL aimed to
infer objectives from qualitative feedback, such as pairwise
preferences between behaviors, rather than relying on quantitative
reward signals. This approach addressed some of the limitations of
conventional RL, where defining appropriate reward functions can be
challenging and prone to reward hacking or unintended behaviors.
The term RLHF was coined later, around 2021-2022, as the
approach gained prominence in the context of training LLMs.
However, the core ideas had been developing for years prior. A

## Page 441

seminal paper by Christiano et al. in 2017 demonstrated the
effectiveness of learning reward models from human preferences
and using them to train RL agents. This work showed that RLHF
could match or exceed the performance of agents trained on hand-
engineered rewards, but with significantly less human effort.
At its core, RLHF works by iteratively improving both a reward model
and a policy:
Reward model learning: Instead of using a pre-defined reward
function, RLHF learns a reward model from human feedback. This
is typically done by presenting humans with different answers and
asking them to indicate which one they prefer. These preferences
are used to train a reward model, often using a Bradley-Terry
model or similar approaches that map preferences to underlying
utility functions.
Policy optimization: With the learned reward model, standard RL
algorithms can be used to optimize a policy. This policy generates
new behaviors that aim to maximize the predicted rewards from
the learned model.
Iterative improvement: As the policy improves, it generates new
behaviors that can be evaluated by humans, leading to
refinements in the reward model. This cycle continues, ideally
resulting in a policy that aligns well with human preferences.

## Page 442

A key innovation in RLHF is its approach to handling the high cost of
human feedback. Rather than requiring constant human oversight,
RLHF allows for asynchronous and sparse feedback.
The learned reward model serves as a proxy for human preferences,
enabling the RL algorithm to train continuously without direct human
input for every action.
As an example, Figure 6.4 shows a high-level view of the Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is one of the most
popular RLHF algorithms. Here, the reward model is used to score
the text that is generated by the trained model. This reward is
regularized by an additional Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence
factor, ensuring that the distribution of tokens stays similar to the
model before training (frozen model).

## Page 443

Figure 6.4 – High-level view of the PPO algorithm for preference
alignment

## Page 444

While RLHF has proven effective for aligning AI systems with human
preferences, it faces challenges due to its iterative nature and
reliance on a separate reward model, which can be computationally
expensive and potentially unstable. Despite theoretical superiority,
RLHF algorithms have also experimentally underperformed
compared to simpler approaches. One such approach that has
gained significant attention is DPO.
Direct Preference Optimization
Introduced by Rafailov et al. in their 2023 paper Direct Preference
Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model,
DPO offers a streamlined alternative to traditional RLHF methods.
DPO’s core innovation lies in its reformulation of the preference
learning problem. Unlike RLHF, which typically involves training a
separate reward model and then using reinforcement learning
algorithms like PPO to fine-tune the language model, DPO takes a
more direct approach.
It derives a closed-form expression for the optimal policy under the
standard RLHF objective of maximizing expected reward subject to a
KL-divergence constraint with a reference policy. This mathematical
insight allows DPO to express the preference learning problem

## Page 445

directly in terms of the policy, eliminating the need for a separate
reward model or complex reinforcement learning algorithms.
In practical terms, DPO can be implemented as a simple binary
cross-entropy loss function that operates directly on the language
model’s output probabilities. This loss function encourages the
model to assign higher probability to preferred responses and lower
probability to non-preferred responses, while maintaining closeness
to a reference (frozen) model. The importance of the reference
model is directly controlled via a beta parameter between 0 and 1.
The reference model is ignored when beta is equal to 0, which
means that the trained model can be very different from the SFT
one. In practice, a value of 0.1 is the most popular one, but this can
be tweaked, as we’ll see in the next section.
The simplicity of this approach allows optimization using standard
gradient descent techniques, without the need for sampling from the
model during training or implementing complex RL algorithms. Figure
6.5 shows a high-level view of the DPO algorithm, greatly simplifying
the training process compared to Figure 6.4.

## Page 446

Figure 6.5 – High-level view of the DPO algorithm for preference
alignment
DPO has several advantages over traditional RLHF methods. As
previously mentioned, it significantly simplifies the preference
learning pipeline, reducing the engineering complexity associated
with RLHF methods. By eliminating the need for a separate reward
model and RL algorithms, DPO is more computationally efficient than

## Page 447

traditional RLHF approaches. Particularly when trained with adapters
(LoRA, QLoRA), the frozen and trained models don’t have to be
separated. Indeed, since we’re only training adapters, the trained
model is not modified. This allows us to only load one model instead
of two, which saves additional VRAM.
Despite its simplicity, DPO often matches the performance of more
complex RLHF methods. It also tends to be more stable during
training and less sensitive to hyperparameters. The simplified
approach makes DPO easier to implement and scale, particularly for
small teams without extensive RL knowledge.
While RLHF allows iterative improvement through multiple training
rounds and can dynamically adapt to new preferences, DPO offers a
more straightforward path to achieving similar results. The choice
between DPO and PPO-based RLHF often comes down to a trade-
off between ease of implementation and potential peak performance.
For large-scale training runs with millions of preference samples,
PPO-inspired methods still have a higher performance ceiling.
However, for most applications, DPO provides the majority of the
performance benefits at a lower computational and engineering cost.
Both RLHF and DPO benefit significantly from the integration of
synthetic data. As LLMs become more capable, they can generate
data that surpasses human-created content in quality and diversity.

## Page 448

This enables a virtuous cycle where better models produce better
training data, which in turn leads to further model improvements. The
iterative nature of both approaches allows multiple rounds of model
refinement, each focusing on different aspects of model performance
and gradually enhancing capabilities across various domains.
Despite its advantages, DPO is not without drawbacks. Like RLHF,
DPO still requires paired preference data, which can be expensive
and time-consuming to collect. DPO lacks some of the theoretical
guarantees associated with reinforcement learning approaches.
There may be scenarios where the added flexibility of RLHF is
beneficial, particularly for complex tasks or environments.
Nonetheless, DPO is ideal in most cases, including our twin LLM
example. In the next section, we will implement it using Unsloth.
Implementing DPO
In this section, we will DPO fine-tune the TwinLlama-3.1-8B model
we created in Chapter 5. For ease of use and to maximize
performance, we will again use the Unsloth library for our DPO
implementation. Depending on the available VRAM, you can choose
between LoRA (higher quality, speed, and VRAM usage) and QLoRA
(lower quality, speed, and VRAM usage). This technique, along with
other preference alignment algorithms, is also available in TRL and
Axolotl.

## Page 449

This example can be seen as an advanced application of DPO.
Indeed, our objective of imitating a writing style conflicts with the
natural tendency of DPO to encourage formal language. This is
partly due to the fact that chosen answers are often more formal
than rejected ones. In practice, this will force us to do light fine-
tuning, with a low learning rate and number of epochs. To find the
best hyperparameters, we trained over 20 models and compared
their outputs on a set of questions, including “Write a paragraph to
introduce supervised fine-tuning.” This allowed us to select the
model and parameters that worked best for this task.
The dependencies are the same as those in Chapter 5 with SFT and
can be found in the book’s GitHub repository
(https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineering) or in
Unsloth’s repo (https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth):
1. First, we want to access a gated model and (optionally) upload
our fine-tuned model to Hugging Face
(https://huggingface.co/). This requires us to log in to an
account. If you don’t have an account, you can create one and
store your API key (Settings | Access Tokens | Create new
token) in the .env file:
HF_TOKEN = YOUR_API_KEY

## Page 450

2. Make sure that your Comet ML API key is also in the .env file.
Otherwise, the code will crash and raise an error when training
starts.
COMET_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
3. Before we import all the necessary packages, we want to apply a
patch for the DPOTrainer class from TRL. This fixes the DPO
logs in notebook environments.
from unsloth import PatchDPOTrainer
PatchDPOTrainer()
4. We can now import the other libraries. The main difference
between DPO and SFT is the import of DPOConfig and
DPOTrainer from TRL, which are specific to DPO training.
import os
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Text
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel, is_bfloat

## Page 451

5. This step loads our fine-tuned model from Chapter 5. We use the
same configuration with a max_seq_length of 2048. You can
activate QLoRA by setting load_in_4bit to True . In the
following, we will perform LoRA DPO fine-tuning for increased
speed and quality.
max_seq_length = 2048
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretra
model_name="mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B",
max_seq_length=max_seq_length,
load_in_4bit=False,
)
6. Let’s now prepare the model for PEFT with the LoRA
configuration. We increase the rank ( r ) and lora_alpha from
32 (as it was in Chapter 5) to 64 . This will allow more
expressive fine-tuning. We keep a dropout of 0 for speed and we
target every linear module as per usual.
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
model,
r=32,
lora_alpha=32,
lora_dropout=0,
target modules=["q proj" "k proj" "v proj"

## Page 452

target_modules=[ q_proj , k_proj , v_proj
)
7. We load the llmtwin-dpo dataset (training split), which contains
our prompts, chosen, and rejected answers.
dataset = load_dataset("mlabonne/llmtwin-dpo", s
8. The data preparation is significantly different from the SFT
example in Chapter 5. Here, we have triples with a prompt, a
chosen answer, and a rejected answer. In the format_samples
function, we apply the Alpaca chat template to each individual
message. Note that the instruction is the only one that requires
the chat format: chosen and rejected answers only need to be
concatenated with the end of sentence (EOS) token. Finally, we
create a train/test split with a 95%/5% ratio.
alpaca_template = """Below is an instruction tha
### Instruction:
{}
### Response:
"""
EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token
def format_samples(example):
example["prompt"] = alpaca template format(e

## Page 453

example[ prompt ] = alpaca_template.format(e
example["chosen"] = example['chosen'] + EOS_
example["rejected"] = example['rejected'] +
return {"prompt": example["prompt"], "chosen
dataset = dataset.map(format_samples)
dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.0
9. The model and data are now ready, so we can start fine-tuning.
Compared to SFT, there are a few new parameters, like
ref_model and beta . Since we’re using LoRA (or QLoRA), we
don’t directly train the model but instead the adapters. This means
we can use the original model (without adapters) as a reference,
saving a lot of VRAM. The beta parameter controls the
importance of the reference model. A standard value of 0.1 works
well in most scenarios, but we decided to increase it to 0.5 based
on our experiments. This is due to the fact that the trained model
used formal language with lower values. Having it closer to the
reference model helps to fix this issue.
The learning rate is also lower (from 3e-4 for SFT to 2e-6 here). We
train for 1 epoch instead of 3, and the max_seq_length parameter
is now broken down into two new parameters: max_prompt_length
(prompt only) and max_length (prompt and answer). Note that we
also replaced the TrainingArguments class with DPOConfig .

## Page 454

trainer = DPOTrainer(
model=model,
ref_model=None,
tokenizer=tokenizer,
beta=0.5,
train_dataset=dataset["train"],
eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
max_length=max_seq_length//2,
max_prompt_length=max_seq_length//2,
args=DPOConfig(
learning_rate=2e-6,
lr_scheduler_type="linear",
per_device_train_batch_size=2,
per_device_eval_batch_size=2,
gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
num_train_epochs=1,
fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),
bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),
optim="adamw_8bit",
weight_decay=0.01,
warmup_steps=10,
output_dir="output",
eval_strategy="steps",
eval_steps=0.2,
logging_steps=1,
report_to="comet_ml",
seed=0,
),

## Page 455

)
trainer.train()
10. Once the model is trained, we can run it for a quick sanity check.
This step is similar to the SFT example. It prepares the model for
inference and generates a response to a prompt.
FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)
message = alpaca_template.format("Write a paragr
inputs = tokenizer([message], return_tensors="pt
text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)
_ = model.generate(**inputs, streamer=text_strea
11. The trained DPO model returns the following response:
Supervised fine-tuning is a method used to enhan
We can compare it with the answer provided by the SFT model:
Supervised fine-tuning is a method used to enhance
The DPO model provides an answer that is both more accurate and
closer to the desired writing style. It correctly identifies pre-training

## Page 456

language models as source models for SFT. It also mentions domain
or task-specific finetunes instead of alignment with “human
expectations,” which is closer to the preference alignment stage. The
answer is also less formal and something we would use in a blog
post.
12. Finally, the last step consists of saving the trained model locally
and pushing it to the Hugging Face Hub.
model.save_pretrained_merged("model", tokenizer,
Congratulations! We have trained and exported our DPO model. It is
now available on the Hugging Face Hub at
https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO.
Compared to SFT, DPO has a few additional metrics that need to be
tracked during training. Figure 6.6 shows the Comet ML dashboard
with the main metrics. You can publicly access it using the following
URL: https://www.comet.com/mlabonne/llm-twin-training/

## Page 457

Figure 6.6 – Experiment tracking in Comet ML with DPO metrics
Let’s review these metrics:
Training loss: We still want the loss to continuously decrease on
average. Note that it can rapidly fall to zero, meaning that the

## Page 458

model is no longer learning anything. This behavior doesn’t
necessarily lead to overfitting or bad models but needs to be
monitored closely.
Validation loss: The same thing can be said about the validation
loss. We expect a small gap compared to the training loss.
Gradient norm: We expect small gradient norms with few spikes.
Rewards: We have two different rewards: chosen and rejected.
They correspond to the mean difference between the log
probabilities output by the trained and reference models. Over
time, we expect the model to choose the chosen answers and
reject the rejected answers, which means that the gap between
them should increase. This difference is directly tracked by the
margins metric, defined as the difference between chosen and
rejected rewards. A well-trained model’s margin will quickly
increase and then plateau.
Accuracies: This metric represents the percentage of times the
model correctly identifies the chosen answers. We want this
accuracy to gradually increase during training, but it doesn’t need
to reach 100%. An accuracy of 100%, especially if it’s achieved
quickly, indicates that the preference dataset might be too easy for
the model. While the LLM can still learn from such a dataset, it
might be beneficial to add more challenging examples.
In general, DPO is slightly harder to monitor and debug than SFT
because it’s a more complex process, involving a reference model.

## Page 459

However, it’s also significantly easier to use than PPO and other
RLHF algorithms. As long as you have a high-quality preference
dataset and a strong fine-tuned model, you can experiment with
different ranks, beta parameters, learning rates, and number of
epochs to see which experiment best captures your preferences.
While this is not the purpose of this chapter, it is possible to
automate the evaluation of models designed to imitate a writing
style. A possible solution consists of comparing the distribution of
words in the text generated by different models (SFT and DPO) with
our ground-truth dataset. In this example, we expect the SFT model
to output a lot of words that are overrepresented in GPT-4o-mini (like
“delve into”). The distribution output by our DPO model should be a
lot closer to the chosen answers.
Summary
This chapter explored preference alignment techniques for improving
LLMs. It introduced the concept of preference datasets, explaining
their structure and importance in capturing nuanced human
preferences. We implemented our own custom preference data
generation pipeline by comparing original and AI-generated text from
real articles. This pipeline can be reused and customized based on
your use case.

## Page 460

We also provided an overview of the evolution of RLHF, leading to
the introduction of DPO as a simpler and more efficient alternative.
Finally, we implemented DPO using the Unsloth library to fine-tune
our TwinLlama-3.1-8B model from Chapter 5. Our step-by-step
tutorial gave practical instructions for training the model, as well as
highlighting key differences from SFT. The final model is available on
the Hugging Face Hub.
In the next chapter, we will explore the crucial topic of LLM
evaluation, addressing the challenges and current approaches in
assessing LLM performance. We’ll cover the creation of domain-
specific evaluation sets, examine why evaluation remains a
persistent problem in the field, and introduce the concept of using
larger models to evaluate smaller ones (LLM-as-a-judge). The
chapter will conclude with a comprehensive evaluation pipeline,
providing a structured framework for consistent and effective LLM
evaluation.

Evaluating LLMs
LLM evaluation is a crucial process used to assess the performance
and capabilities of LLM models. It can take multiple forms, such as
multiple-choice question answering, open-ended instructions, and
feedback from real users. Currently, there is no unified approach to
measuring a model’s performance but there are patterns and recipes
that we can adapt to specific use cases.
While general-purpose evaluations are the most popular ones, with
benchmarks like Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding
(MMLU) or LMSYS Chatbot Arena, domain- and task-specific
models benefit from more narrow approaches. This is particularly
true when dealing with entire LLM systems (as opposed to models),
often centered around a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
pipeline. In these scenarios, we need to expand our evaluation
framework to encompass the entire system, including new modules
like retrievers and post-processors.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
Model evaluation
RAG evaluation

## Page 465

Evaluating TwinLlama-3.1-8B
By the end of this chapter, you will know the most popular LLM
evaluations and how to evaluate models and RAG systems using
different techniques.
Model evaluation
In model evaluation, the objective is to assess the capabilities of a
single model without any prompt engineering, RAG pipeline, and so
on.
This evaluation is essential for several reasons, such as selecting
the most relevant LLM or making sure that the fine-tuning process
actually improved the model. In this section, we will compare ML and
LLM evaluation to understand the main differences between these
two fields. We will then explore benchmarks for general-purpose,
domain-specific, and task-specific models.
Comparing ML and LLM evaluation
ML evaluation is centered on assessing the performance of models
designed for tasks like prediction, classification, and regression.
Unlike the evaluation of LLMs, which often focuses on how well a
model understands and generates language, ML evaluation is more

## Page 466

concerned with how accurately and efficiently a model can process
structured data to produce specific outcomes.
This difference comes from the nature of the tasks these models
handle. ML models are generally designed for narrowly defined
problems, such as predicting stock prices or detecting outliers, which
often involve numerical or categorical data, making the evaluation
process more straightforward. On the other hand, LLMs are tasked
with interpreting and generating language, which adds a layer of
subjectivity to the evaluation process. Instead of relying solely on
numerical benchmarks, LLM evaluation requires a more nuanced
approach and often incorporates qualitative assessments, examining
how well the model produces coherent, relevant, and contextually
accurate responses in natural language.
In particular, we can see three key differences in how these models
work, which impact the evaluation process:
Numerical metrics: Evaluating ML models typically involves
measuring objective performance metrics, such as accuracy,
precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the type of
task at hand. This is less clear with LLMs, which can handle
multiple tasks (hence, multiple evaluations) and can rarely rely on
the same numerical metrics.

## Page 467

Feature engineering: In traditional ML, a critical part of the
process involves manually selecting and transforming relevant
data features before training the model. Evaluating the success of
this feature engineering often becomes part of the broader model
evaluation. LLMs, however, are designed to handle raw text data
directly, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
Interpretability: With ML models, it is easier to interpret why a
model made certain predictions or classifications, and this
interpretability can be a core part of their evaluation. This direct
interpretation is not possible with LLMs. However, requesting
explanations during the generation process can give insights into
the model’s decision-making process.
In the following section, we will see a more fine-grained exploration
of different types of LLMs. While evaluating general-purpose models
is fairly disconnected from ML evaluation, task-specific LLMs are
more closely aligned with traditional ML.
General-purpose LLM evaluations
General-purpose evaluations refer to metrics dedicated to base and
general-purpose fine-tuned models. They cover a breadth of
capabilities that are correlated with knowledge and usefulness
without focusing on specific tasks or domains. This allows
developers to get an overview of these capabilities, compare

## Page 468

themselves with competitors, and identify strengths and
weaknesses. Based on these results, it is possible to tweak the
dataset and hyperparameters, or even modify the architecture.
We can broadly categorize general-purpose evaluations in three
phases: during pre-training, after pre-training, and after fine-tuning.
During pre-training, we closely monitor how the model learns, as
shown at the end of Chapter 5. The most straightforward metrics are
low-level and correspond to how models are trained:
Training loss: Based on the cross-entropy loss, measures the
difference between the model’s predicted probability distribution
and the true distribution of the next token
Validation loss: Calculates the same loss as training loss, but on
a held-out validation set to assess generalization
Perplexity: Exponential of the cross-entropy loss, representing
how “surprised” the model is by the data (lower is better)
Gradient norm: Monitors the magnitude of gradients during
training to detect potential instabilities or vanishing/exploding
gradients
It’s also possible to include benchmarks like HellaSwag (common
sense reasoning) during this stage but there’s a risk of overfitting
these evaluations.

## Page 469

After pre-training, it is common to use a suite of evaluations to
evaluate the base model. This suite can include internal and public
benchmarks. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of common public pre-
training evaluations:
MMLU (knowledge): Tests models on multiple-choice questions
across 57 subjects, from elementary to professional levels
HellaSwag (reasoning): Challenges models to complete a given
situation with the most plausible ending from multiple choices
ARC-C (reasoning): Evaluates models on grade-school-level
multiple-choice science questions requiring causal reasoning
Winogrande (reasoning): Assesses common sense reasoning
through pronoun resolution in carefully crafted sentences
PIQA (reasoning): Measures physical common sense
understanding through questions about everyday physical
interactions
Many of these datasets are also used to evaluate general-purpose
fine-tuned models. In this case, we focus on the difference in a given
score between the base and the fine-tuned model. For example, bad
fine-tuning can degrade the knowledge of the model, measured by
MMLU. On the contrary, a good one might instill even more
knowledge and increase the MMLU score.

## Page 470

This can also help identify any contamination issues, where the
model might have been fine-tuned on data that is too close to a test
set. For instance, improving the MMLU score of a base model by 10
points during the fine-tuning phase is unlikely. This is a sign that the
instruction data might be contaminated.
In addition to these pre-trained evaluations, fine-tuned models also
have their own benchmarks. Here, we use the term “fine-tuned
model” to designate a model that has been trained with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and preference alignment. These benchmarks
target capabilities connected to the ability of fine-tuned models to
understand and answer questions. In particular, they test instruction-
following, multi-turn conversation, and agentic skills:
IFEval (instruction following): Assesses a model’s ability to
follow instructions with particular constraints, like not outputting
any commas in your answer
Chatbot Arena (conversation): A framework where humans vote
for the best answer to an instruction, comparing two models in
head-to-head conversations
AlpacaEval (instruction following): Automatic evaluation for
fine-tuned models that is highly correlated with Chatbot Arena
MT-Bench (conversation): Evaluates models on multi-turn
conversations, testing their ability to maintain context and provide
coherent responses

## Page 471

GAIA (agentic): Tests a wide range of abilities like tool use and
web browsing, in a multi-step fashion
Understanding how these evaluations are designed and used is
important to choose the best LLM for your application. For example,
if you want to fine-tune a model, you want the best base model in
terms of knowledge and reasoning for a given size. This allows you
to compare the capabilities of different LLMs and pick the one that
will offer the strongest foundation for your fine-tuning.
Even if you don’t want to fine-tune a model, benchmarks like Chatbot
Arena or IFEval are a good way to compare different instruct models.
For instance, you want great conversational abilities if you’re building
a chatbot. However, this is not necessary if your end goal is
something like information extraction from unstructured documents.
In this case, you will benefit more from excellent instruction-following
skills to understand and execute tasks.
While these benchmarks are popular and useful, they also suffer
from inherent flaws. For example, public benchmarks can be gamed
by training models on test data or samples that are very similar to
benchmark datasets. Even human evaluation is not perfect and is
often biased toward long and confident answers, especially when
they’re nicely formatted (e.g., using Markdown). On the other hand,

## Page 472

private test sets have not been scrutinized as much as public ones
and might have their own issues and biases.
This means that benchmarks are not a single source of truth but
should be used as signals. Once multiple evaluations provide a
similar answer, you can raise your confidence level about the real
capabilities of a model.
Domain-specific LLM evaluations
Domain-specific LLMs don’t have the same scope as general-
purpose models. This is helpful to target more fine-grained
capabilities with more depth than the previous benchmarks.
Within the category, the choice of benchmarks entirely depends on
the domain in question. For common applications like a language-
specific model or a code model, it is recommended to search for
relevant evaluations and even benchmark suites. These suites
encompass different benchmarks and are designed to be
reproducible. By targeting different aspects of a domain, they often
capture domain performance more accurately.
To illustrate this, here is a list of domain-specific evaluations with
leaderboards on the Hugging Face Hub:

## Page 473

Open Medical-LLM Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance of
LLMs in medical question-answering tasks. It regroups 9 metrics,
with 1,273 questions from the US medical license exams
(MedQA), 500 questions from PubMed articles (PubMedQA),
4,183 questions from Indian medical entrance exams
(MedMCQA), and 1,089 questions from 6 sub-categories of
MMLU (clinical knowledge, medical genetics, anatomy,
professional medicine, college biology, and college medicine).
BigCodeBench Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance of
code LLMs, featuring two main categories: BigCodeBench-
Complete for code completion based on structured docstrings,
and BigCodeBench-Instruct for code generation from natural
language instructions. Models are ranked by their Pass@1 scores
using greedy decoding, with an additional Elo rating for the
Complete variant. It covers a wide range of programming
scenarios that test LLMs’ compositional reasoning and instruction-
following capabilities.
Hallucinations Leaderboard: Evaluates LLMs’ tendency to
produce false or unsupported information across 16 diverse tasks
spanning 5 categories. These include Question Answering (with
datasets like NQ Open, TruthfulQA, and SQuADv2), Reading
Comprehension (using TriviaQA and RACE), Summarization
(employing HaluEval Summ, XSum, and CNN/DM), Dialogue
(featuring HaluEval Dial and FaithDial), and Fact Checking

## Page 474

(utilizing MemoTrap, SelfCheckGPT, FEVER, and TrueFalse). The
leaderboard also assesses instruction-following ability using
IFEval.
Enterprise Scenarios Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance
of LLMs on six real-world enterprise use cases, covering diverse
tasks relevant to business applications. The benchmarks include
FinanceBench (100 financial questions with retrieved context),
Legal Confidentiality (100 prompts from LegalBench for legal
reasoning), Writing Prompts (creative writing evaluation),
Customer Support Dialogue (relevance in customer service
interactions), Toxic Prompts (safety assessment for harmful
content generation), and Enterprise PII (business safety for
sensitive information protection). Some test sets are closed-
source to prevent gaming of the leaderboard. The evaluation
focuses on specific capabilities such as answer accuracy, legal
reasoning, creative writing, contextual relevance, and safety
measures, providing a comprehensive assessment of LLMs’
suitability for enterprise environments.
Leaderboards can have different approaches based on their domain.
For example, BigCodeBench is significantly different from others
because it relies on only two metrics that sufficiently capture the
entire domain. On the other hand, the Hallucinations Leaderboard
regroups 16 metrics, including many general-purpose evaluations. It

## Page 475

shows that in addition to custom benchmarks, reusing general-
purpose ones can complete your own suite.
In particular, language-specific LLMs often reuse translated versions
of general-purpose benchmarks. This can be completed with original
evaluations in the native language. While some of these benchmarks
use machine translation, it is better to rely on human-translated
evaluations to improve their quality. We selected the following three
task-specific leaderboards and their respective evaluation suites to
give you an idea of how to build your own:
OpenKo-LLM Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance of
Korean LLMs using nine metrics. These metrics are a combination
of general-purpose benchmarks translated into Korean (GPQA,
Winogrande, GSM8K, EQ-Bench, and IFEval) and custom
evaluations (Knowledge, Social Value, Harmlessness, and
Helpfulness).
Open Portuguese LLM Leaderboard: Evaluates the
performance of Portuguese language LLMs using nine diverse
benchmarks. These benchmarks include educational
assessments (ENEM with 1,430 questions, and BLUEX with 724
questions from university entrance exams), professional exams
(OAB Exams with over 2,000 questions), language understanding
tasks (ASSIN2 RTE and STS, FAQUAD NLI), and social media

## Page 476

content analysis (HateBR with 7,000 Instagram comments, PT
Hate Speech with 5,668 tweets, and tweetSentBR).
Open Arabic LLM Leaderboard: Evaluates the performance of
Arabic language LLMs using a comprehensive set of benchmarks,
including both native Arabic tasks and translated datasets. The
leaderboard features two native Arabic benchmarks: AlGhafa and
Arabic-Culture-Value-Alignment. Additionally, it incorporates 12
translated benchmarks covering various domains, such as MMLU,
ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and PIQA.
Both general-purpose and domain-specific evaluations are designed
with three main principles. First, they should be complex and
challenge models to distinguish good and bad outputs. Second, they
should be diverse and cover as many topics and scenarios as
possible. When one benchmark is not enough, additional ones can
create a stronger suite. Finally, they should be practical and easy to
run. This is more connected to evaluation libraries, which can be
more or less complex to work with. We recommend lm-evaluation-
harness (github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) from
Eleuther AI and lighteval (github.com/huggingface/lighteval)
from Hugging Face to run your benchmarks.
Task-specific LLM evaluations

## Page 477

While general-purpose and domain-specific evaluations indicate
strong base or instruct models, they cannot provide insights into how
well these models work for a given task. This requires benchmarks
specifically designed for this purpose, measuring downstream
performance.
Because of their narrow focus, task-specific LLMs can rarely rely on
pre-existing evaluation datasets. This can be advantageous because
their outputs also tend to be more structured and easier to evaluate
using traditional ML metrics. For example, a summarization task can
leverage the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation
(ROUGE) metric, which measures the overlap between the
generated text and reference text using n-grams.
Likewise, classification tasks also benefit from it and use the
following classic metrics, among others:
Accuracy: Accuracy refers to the proportion of correctly predicted
instances compared to the total instances. It’s particularly useful
for tasks with categorical outputs or where there is a clear
distinction between right and wrong answers, such as named
entity recognition (NER).
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total
positive predictions made by the model.

## Page 478

Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual
positive instances.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, used to
balance both metrics. These are particularly useful in tasks such
as classification or entity extraction.
When the task cannot be directly mapped to a traditional ML task, it
is possible to create a custom benchmark. This benchmark can be
inspired by general-purpose and domain-specific evaluation
datasets. A common and successful pattern is the use of multiple-
choice question answering. In this framework, the instruction
consists of a question with several options. See the following
example with a question from the MMLU dataset (abstract algebra):
Instruction
Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))
over Q.
A. 0
B. 4
C. 2
D. 6
Output
B

## Page 479

Table 7.1: Example from the MMLU dataset
There are two main ways of evaluating models with this scheme—
text generation and log-likelihood evaluations:
The first approach involves having the model generate text
responses and comparing those to predefined answer choices.
For example, the model generates a letter (A, B, C, or D) as its
answer, which is then checked against the correct answer. This
method tests the model’s ability to produce coherent and accurate
responses in a format similar to how it would be used in real-world
applications.
Evaluation using probabilities, on the other hand, looks at the
model’s predicted probabilities for different answer options without
requiring text generation. For MMLU, lm-evaluation-harness
compares the probabilities for the full text of each answer choice.
This approach allows for a more nuanced assessment of the
model’s understanding, as it can capture the relative confidence
the model has in different options, even if it wouldn’t necessarily
generate the exact correct answer text.
For simplicity, we recommend the text-generation version of the
evaluation that mimics human test-taking. It is easier to implement,
and generally more discriminative, as low-quality models tend to
overperform on probability-based evaluations. You can adapt this

## Page 480

technique to quiz your models about a particular task, and even
expand it to specific domains.
Conversely, if the task is too open-ended, traditional ML metrics and
multiple-choice question answering might not be relevant. In this
scenario, the LLM-as-a-judge technique introduced in Chapter 5 can
be used to evaluate the quality of the answers. If you have ground-
truth answers, providing them as additional context improves the
accuracy of the evaluation. Otherwise, defining different dimensions
(such as relevance or toxicity, depending on your task) can also
ground the evaluation in more interpretable categories.
It is recommended to use large models for evaluation and to
iteratively refine your prompt. In this process, the explanations
outputted by the model are important for understanding errors in its
reasoning and fixing them through additional prompt engineering.
In order to easily parse answers, one can specify a structure in the
instruction or use some kind of structured generation (like Outlines or
OpenAI’s JSON mode). Here is an example of an instruction with a
structure:
You are an evaluator who assesses the quality of an
answer to an instruction.

## Page 481

Your goal is to provide a score that represents how
well the answer addresses the instruction.
You will use a scale of 1 to 4, where each number
represents the following:
1. The answer is not relevant to the instruction.
2. The answer is relevant but not helpful.
3. The answer is relevant and helpful but could be
more detailed.
4. The answer is relevant, helpful, and detailed.
Please provide your evaluation as follows:
##Evaluation##
Explanation: (analyze the relevant, helpfulness, and
complexity of the answer)
Total rating: (final score as a number between 1 and
4)
Instruction:
{instruction}
Answer:
{answer}
##Evaluation##
Explanation:
Table 7.2: Example of general-purpose LLM-as-a-judge prompt for
answer evaluation

## Page 482

Naturally, you can tweak the scale, add a ground-truth answer to this
prompt, and customize it for your own use cases.
However, judge LLMs can exhibit biases favoring assertive or
verbose responses, potentially overrating answers that sound more
confident but are less accurate. They may also lack domain
expertise for specialized topics, leading to misjudgments.
Consistency is also a concern, as LLMs might score similar
responses differently. Additionally, they could have implicit
preferences for certain writing styles unrelated to actual answer
quality. To mitigate these issues, it’s possible to combine LLM
evaluations with other metrics, use multiple judges, and carefully
design prompts to address biases.
Once a model has been properly evaluated and works as intended, it
might be included within a broader system. In the next section, we
will see how systems change the evaluation framework.
RAG evaluation
While traditional LLM evaluation focuses on the model’s inherent
capabilities, RAG evaluation requires a more comprehensive
approach that considers both the model’s generative abilities and its
interaction with external information sources.

## Page 483

RAG systems combine the strengths of LLMs with information
retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to generate responses that are
not only coherent and contextually appropriate but also grounded in
up-to-date, externally sourced information. This makes RAG
particularly valuable in fields where current and accurate information
is crucial, such as news reporting, research, and customer support.
The evaluation of RAG systems goes beyond assessing a
standalone LLM. It requires examining the entire system’s
performance, including:
Retrieval accuracy: How well does the system fetch relevant
information?
Integration quality: How effectively is the retrieved information
incorporated into the generated response?
Factuality and relevance: Does the final output address the
query appropriately while seamlessly blending retrieved and
generated content?
Key metrics for RAG evaluation include retrieval precision and recall,
which measure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the
retrieved information. Additionally, the quality of integration between
retrieved data and generated text is crucial, as is the overall
factuality and coherence of the output.

## Page 484

To illustrate how these metrics are applied in practice, consider a
RAG system designed for a customer support chatbot in an e-
commerce setting. In this scenario, the user asks “What’s your return
policy for laptops purchased during the holiday sale?” The RAG
pipeline finds relevant documents on the electronics return policy
and documents on holiday sale terms. This additional context is
appended at the end of the question, and the model uses it to
respond:
For laptops purchased during our holiday sale, you
have an extended return period of 60 days from the
date of purchase. This is longer than our standard
30-day return policy for electronics. Please ensure
the laptop is in its original packaging with all
accessories to be eligible for a full refund.
Table 7.3: Example of output from a RAG pipeline designed for
customer support
In this pipeline, we can evaluate if the retrieved documents
correspond to what was expected (retrieval accuracy). We can also
measure the difference between responses with and without
additional context (integration quality). Finally, we can assess

## Page 485

whether the output is relevant and grounded in the information
provided by the documents (factuality and relevance).
In this section, we will cover two methods to evaluate how well RAG
models incorporate external information into their responses.
Ragas
Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment (Ragas) is an
open-source toolkit designed to provide developers with a
comprehensive set of tools for RAG evaluation and optimization. It’s
designed around the idea of metrics-driven development (MDD), a
product development approach that relies on data to make well-
informed decisions, involving the ongoing monitoring of essential
metrics over time to gain valuable insights into an application’s
performance. By embracing this methodology, Ragas enables
developers to objectively assess their RAG systems, identify areas
for improvement, and track the impact of changes over time.
One of the key capabilities of Ragas is its ability to synthetically
generate diverse and complex test datasets. This feature addresses
a significant pain point in RAG development, as manually creating
hundreds of questions, answers, and contexts is both time-
consuming and labor-intensive. Instead, it uses an evolutionary
approach paradigm inspired by works like Evol-Instruct to craft

## Page 486

questions with varying characteristics such as reasoning complexity,
conditional elements, and multi-context requirements. This approach
ensures a comprehensive evaluation of different components within
the RAG pipeline.
Additionally, Ragas can generate conversational samples that
simulate chat-based question-and-follow-up interactions, allowing
developers to evaluate their systems in more realistic scenarios.
Figure 7.1: Overview of the Ragas evaluation framework
As illustrated in Figure 7.1, Ragas provides a suite of LLM-assisted
evaluation metrics designed to objectively measure different aspects
of RAG system performance. These metrics include:
Faithfulness: This metric measures the factual consistency of the
generated answer against the given context. It works by breaking
down the answer into individual claims and verifying if each claim

## Page 487

can be inferred from the provided context. The faithfulness score
is calculated as the ratio of verifiable claims to the total number of
claims in the answer.
Answer relevancy: This metric evaluates how pertinent the
generated answer is to the given prompt. It uses an innovative
approach where an LLM is prompted to generate multiple
questions based on the answer and then calculates the mean
cosine similarity between these generated questions and the
original question. This method helps identify answers that may be
factually correct but off-topic or incomplete.
Context precision: This metric evaluates whether all the ground-
truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked
appropriately. It considers the position of relevant information
within the retrieved context, rewarding systems that place the
most pertinent information at the top.
Context recall: This metric measures the extent to which the
retrieved context aligns with the annotated answer (ground truth).
It analyzes each claim in the ground truth answer to determine
whether it can be attributed to the retrieved context, providing
insights into the completeness of the retrieved information.
Finally, Ragas also provides building blocks for monitoring RAG
quality in production environments. This facilitates continuous
improvement of RAG systems. By leveraging the evaluation results
from test datasets and insights gathered from production monitoring,

## Page 488

developers can iteratively enhance their applications. This might
involve fine-tuning retrieval algorithms, adjusting prompt engineering
strategies, or optimizing the balance between retrieved context and
LLM generation.
Ragas can be complemented with another approach, based on
custom classifiers.
ARES
ARES (an automated evaluation framework for RAG systems) is a
comprehensive tool designed to evaluate RAG systems. It offers an
automated process that combines synthetic data generation with
fine-tuned classifiers to assess various aspects of RAG
performance, including context relevance, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevance.
The ARES framework operates in three main stages: synthetic data
generation, classifier training, and RAG evaluation. Each stage is
configurable, allowing users to tailor the evaluation process to their
specific needs and datasets.
In the synthetic data generation stage, ARES creates datasets that
closely mimic real-world scenarios for robust RAG testing. Users can
configure this process by specifying document file paths, few-shot
prompt files, and output locations for the synthetic queries. The

## Page 489

framework supports various pre-trained language models for this
task, with the default being google/flan-t5-xxl. Users can control the
number of documents sampled and other parameters to balance
between comprehensive coverage and computational efficiency.
Figure 7.2: Overview of the ARES evaluation framework
The classifier training stage involves creating high-precision
classifiers to determine the relevance and faithfulness of RAG
outputs. Users can specify the classification dataset (typically
generated from the previous stage), test set for evaluation, label
columns, and model choice. ARES uses microsoft/deberta-v3-large
as the default model but supports other Hugging Face models.
Training parameters such as the number of epochs, patience value

## Page 490

for early stopping, and learning rate can be fine-tuned to optimize
classifier performance.
The final stage, RAG evaluation, leverages the trained classifiers
and synthetic data to assess the RAG model’s performance. Users
provide evaluation datasets, few-shot examples for guiding the
evaluation, classifier checkpoints, and gold label paths. ARES
supports various evaluation metrics and can generate confidence
intervals for its assessments.
ARES offers flexible model execution options, supporting both cloud-
based and local runs through vLLM integration. The framework also
supports various artifact types (code snippets, documents, HTML,
images, and so on), enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different RAG system outputs.
In summary, Ragas and ARES complement each other through their
distinct approaches to evaluation and dataset generation. Ragas’s
strength in production monitoring and LLM-assisted metrics can be
combined with ARES’s highly configurable evaluation process and
classifier-based assessments. While Ragas may offer more nuanced
evaluations based on LLM capabilities, ARES provides consistent
and potentially faster evaluations once its classifiers are trained.
Combining them offers a comprehensive evaluation framework,

## Page 491

benefiting from quick iterations with Ragas and in-depth, customized
evaluations with ARES at key stages.
In the next section, we will create our own evaluation framework to
evaluate our task-specific TwinLlama-3.1-8B model.
Evaluating TwinLlama-3.1-8B
In the previous chapters, we created two models fine-tuned to
generate high-quality posts and articles: TwinLlama-3.1-8B and
TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO. Based on this summary, we want to assess
their abilities to write text that is both accurate and well-written. In
comparison, general-purpose fine-tuned models are accurate thanks
to their extensive knowledge but often use overly formal and verbose
language. With this fine-tuning, we want to adopt a more natural
writing style, based on the original articles from the training set.
Due to the open-ended nature of this problem, we will leverage a
judge LLM to evaluate the quality of the generated text. It will take
both the instruction and the answer as inputs, and score it on a 1–3
scale based on two criteria:
Accuracy: The degree of factual correctness and
comprehensiveness of the information presented in the answer
Style: The appropriateness of the tone and writing style for blog
posts or social media content (no formal or academic

## Page 492

expressions)
In our evaluation framework, we will use the test split of our
instruction dataset to get test instructions. We will feed them to our
models and generate answers. These answers will then be
evaluated by our judge LLM (GPT-4o-mini), based on a prompt that
specifies our criteria. Finally, we will analyze the scores and draw
conclusions based on qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
Generating answers
The first step consists of efficiently generating answers for each
instruction in our test set. In addition to our two models, we will also
use meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, the official instruct
version of Llama-3.1-8B, as a reference point to better understand
the trade-offs we made.
Let’s start the first stage of the implementation:
1. We import the relevant libraries, including vLLM for fast
generation. This library is a lot faster than transformers for batch
generation with local models:
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
from datasets import load_dataset

## Page 493

from tqdm.auto import tqdm
import gc
2. We define a function called generate_answers that will process
our dataset and generate responses using a specified model. It
takes two inputs—the ID of the model we want to use and the
name of the test dataset:
def generate_answers(model_id, dataset_name):
dataset = load_dataset(dataset_name, split="
3. We need to format the raw instructions using the chat template
our models have been trained on. Note that Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
has been used with a different template, but it can follow this
simple format. Here, we use the same chat template with every
model for simplicity. We map the entire test set to this template
with the format() function:
def format(sample):
return "Below is an instruction that des
dataset = dataset.map(lambda sample: {"promp

## Page 494

4. Let’s initialize the LLM object used by vLLM with a maximum
length of 4,096 tokens. We can also specify sampling parameters,
which correspond to variables used in the decoding strategy.
Here, we use parameters to encourage diversity (high
temperature) while removing the most unlikely tokens ( top_p
and min_p ). Finally, we start the generation by providing the list
of prompts with dataset["prompt"] :
llm = LLM(model=model_id, max_model_len=4096
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature
outputs = llm.generate(dataset["prompt"], sa
5. This process should take a few minutes with our 334 prompts.
Once this is done, we extract the answers from the object that is
outputted by vLLM. We then add these answers as a new column
to our dataset. This is useful to log the answers and review them
later:
answers = [output.outputs[0].text for output
dataset = dataset.add_column("answers", answ
6. We save our results to the Hugging Face Hub for easy access
later. Then, we clear our GPU memory to prevent running out of

## Page 495

space when we process the next model:
print(f"Uploading results for {model_id}")
dataset.push_to_hub(f"mlabonne/{model_id.spl
gc.collect()
return dataset
7. We create a list of the three models we want to test. Then, we run
our generate_answers() function for each of these models,
one at a time. This will create and upload a separate set of results
for each model:
model_ids = [
'mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B',
'mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO',
'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct'
]
for model_id in model_ids:
generate_answers(model_id, "mlabonne/llmtwin
Now that we have the answer generation, we can move on to the
evaluation process.
Evaluating answers

## Page 496

To evaluate our answers, we will rely on GPT-4o-mini as a judge.
This strategy is similar to what we used for data generation. As a
matter of fact, you could adapt it to filter out bad samples during the
data generation process. Here, we will score every generated
answer from every model in terms of accuracy and style. The
average scores will inform us about the quality of our fine-tuning
compared to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct:
1. First, we import the required libraries, including openai :
import json
from typing import List
from datasets import Dataset, load_dataset
from openai import OpenAI
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
import concurrent.futures
2. We then define the evaluate_answer() function. This function
contains our evaluation prompt, which sets up the context for
evaluating answers based on accuracy and style:
def evaluate_answer(
instruction: str, answer: str, client: OpenA
) -> dict:
prompt = f"""You are an expert judge. Please
1 Accuracy: How factually correct is the inform

## Page 497

1. Accuracy: How factually correct is the inform
2. Style: Is the tone and writing style appropri
3. In the same prompt, we define our scales for each metric. Those
are three-point Likert scales with a precise definition for each
score:
Accuracy scale:
1 (Poor): Contains factual errors or misleading
2 (Good): Mostly accurate with minor errors or o
3 (Excellent): Highly accurate and comprehensive
Style scale:
1 (Poor): Too formal, uses some overly complex w
2 (Good): Good balance of technical content and
3 (Excellent): Perfectly accessible language for
4. Finally, we conclude the prompt with two examples to illustrate
what we mean by “complex words” and “formal or academic
language.” We provide the corresponding instruction-answer pair
and ask the model to return a response in JSON:
Example of bad style: The Llama2 7B model consti
Example of excellent style: Llama2 7B outperform
Instruction: {instruction}

Provide your evaluation in JSON format with the

## Page 498

Provide your evaluation in JSON format with the
{{
"accuracy": {{
"analysis": "...",
"score": 0
}},
"style": {{
"analysis": "...",
"score": 0
}}

"""
5. This prompt is given as a user query to the GPT-4o-mini model.
The system prompt reinforces that we are interested in answer
evaluation based on accuracy and style:
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o-mini",
messages=[
{
"role": "system",
"content": "You are a helpful as
},
{"role": "user", "content": prompt},
],
response_format={"type": "json_object"},
max tokens=1000

## Page 499

max_tokens=1000,
temperature=0.8,
)
6. As in the previous chapters, we will batch our requests to speed
up the process. This is why we create an evaluate_batch()
function, which returns a list of parsed structured outputs with
their corresponding indices. These indices are important to ensure
a correct ordering of the evaluations:
def evaluate_batch(batch, start_index):
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)
return [
(i, evaluate_answer(instr, ans, client))
for i, (instr, ans) in enumerate(batch,
]
7. We can now orchestrate the previous code in the
evaluate_answers() function. It takes the model ID, number of
threads, and batch size as inputs. First, we load the dataset with
the generations we previously saved:
def evaluate_answers(model_id: str, num_threads
dataset = load_dataset(f"mlabonne/{model_id

## Page 500

8. We create batches of instruction-answer pairs from our dataset.
Each batch contains batch_size number of pairs:
batches = [
(i, list(zip(dataset["instruction"][i:i+
for i in range(0, len(dataset), batch_si
]
9. We perform parallel evaluation of batches of instruction-answer
pairs using multiple threads. We use parallel processing to
evaluate multiple batches simultaneously, speeding up the overall
evaluation process. The ThreadPoolExecutor submits each
batch to evaluate_batch() . The results are stored in the
evaluations list:
evaluations = [None] * len(dataset)
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(m
futures = [executor.submit(evaluate_batc
for future in tqdm(concurrent.futures.as
for index, evaluation in future.resu
evaluations[index] = evaluation
10. We create a new column with the result of the evaluation process.
This column will store the raw JSON output of the judge model,

## Page 501

including scores and explanations:
if 'evaluation' in dataset.column_names:
dataset = dataset.remove_columns(['evalu
dataset = dataset.add_column("evaluation", e
11. We can directly parse this JSON object with json.loads() and
try to retrieve the accuracy and style scores that should have
been generated. This generation is in best-effort mode, which
means that scores are not guaranteed. If there’s an error in
parsing, we use None values as a fallback:
accuracy_scores = []
style_scores = []
for evaluation in dataset['evaluation']:
try:
eval_dict = json.loads(evaluation) i
accuracy_score = eval_dict['accuracy
style_score = eval_dict['style']['sc
accuracy_scores.append(accuracy_scor
style_scores.append(style_score)
except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError,
accuracy_scores.append(None)
style_scores.append(None)

## Page 502

12. We add two new columns to store the accuracy and style scores
for further analysis:
if 'accuracy' in dataset.column_names:
dataset = dataset.remove_columns(['accur
dataset = dataset.add_column('accuracy', acc
if 'style' in dataset.column_names:
dataset = dataset.remove_columns(['style
dataset = dataset.add_column('style', style_
13. Let’s push the final dataset with generated answers, evaluations,
and scores to the Hugging Face Hub:
dataset.push_to_hub(f"mlabonne/{model_id.spl
return dataset
14. We can now call the evaluate_answers() function with the
three models we selected:
model_ids = [
'mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B',
'mlabonne/TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO',
'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct'
]

## Page 503

for model_id in model_ids:
evaluate_answers(model_id)
By saving intermediate results, our evaluation framework becomes
more robust to failures. It is also easily extendable to other models,
datasets, and criteria.
Analyzing results
There are three elements we can review at the end of this evaluation
process: model answers, explanations from evaluations, and scores.
While reviewing answers is not scalable, it is a crucial step that can
help to identify a lot of common mistakes, such as a wrong chat
template or incorrect model. Here, we will focus on a single
instruction and read the answers provided by our two models and
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Instruction
Discuss the concept of algorithm bias and its implications.
TwinLlama-3.1-8B
Algorithm bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to produce
outcomes that are skewed or unfair due to underlying
assumptions or programming biases. This can have significant

## Page 504

implications, particularly in fields like machine learning and AI,
where algorithms are relied upon to make critical decisions. If an
algorithm is not properly vetted for bias, it may lead to
discriminatory outcomes, such as lending practices that
disproportionately affect certain demographic groups or
recruitment processes that unfairly favor certain candidates. It is
essential to ensure that algorithms are designed and
implemented with fairness and accuracy in mind to mitigate
these risks.
TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO
Algorithm bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to produce
outcomes that are skewed or unfair due to underlying
assumptions or programming biases. This can have significant
implications, particularly in fields like machine learning and AI,
where algorithms are relied upon to make critical decisions. If an
algorithm is not properly vetted for bias, it could lead to
discriminatory outcomes, such as denying loans to certain
demographic groups or perpetuating stereotypes. Therefore, it is
essential to address algorithmic bias proactively to ensure that
the technology we develop is equitable and just.
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

## Page 505

Algorithm bias, also known as algorithmic bias, refers to the
unintended or inherent bias in machine learning models that can
affect their performance, accuracy, and fairness. This bias can
be caused by various factors, including the data used to train the
model, the algorithm itself, and the biases present in the society
or culture. One of the most significant implications of algorithm
bias is its potential to perpetuate and exacerbate existing social
inequalities. For instance, facial recognition software has been
shown to be less accurate for people of color, leading to wrongful
arrests and discrimination. Similarly, language processing
models have been found to be biased towards the language and
dialect of the dominant group, making it difficult for marginalized
communities to access information and services. Algorithm bias
can also have severe consequences in areas such as
healthcare, education, and employment. For example, a medical
diagnosis algorithm that is biased towards certain demographics
may misdiagnose or underdiagnose conditions in other groups,
leading to delayed or inadequate treatment. In education, an
algorithm that is biased towards certain learning styles may
disproportionately affect students with different learning abilities,
leading to unequal opportunities. To mitigate the effects of
algorithm bias, it is essential to address the root causes of bias
and implement measures to ensure fairness and transparency in
machine learning models. This can be achieved through

## Page 506

techniques such as data cleansing, regularization, and
debiasing, as well as implementing diverse and representative
datasets. Additionally, it is crucial to involve diverse
stakeholders, including members of marginalized communities,
in the development and testing of algorithms to ensure that they
are fair and equitable. In conclusion, algorithm bias is a
significant concern that can have far-reaching implications for
individuals and society as a whole. It is essential to recognize
the potential biases in machine learning models and take
proactive steps to mitigate their effects. By doing so, we can
create more equitable and just systems that benefit everyone,
regardless of their background or demographic characteristics.
Table 7.4: Example of generated answers for a given instruction
Immediately, we can see that the answers from our models are very
close to each other. This is not the case with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct’s
answer, which is extremely verbose and lists many examples. This is
typically the kind of answer that is correct but can feel artificial and
unpleasant to read because of its length. On the other hand, the
DPO model slightly simplifies the language of the SFT version,
making it less academic. This is exactly the behavior we want to
capture, modifying the writing style but not the actual content of the
answer.

Let’s now review the evaluations provided by GPT-4o-mini for each

Table 7.5: Evaluations of each answer made by GPT-4o-mini,
according to style and accuracy
According to our judge LLM, there is no issue with the accuracy of
the answers, which get a perfect score. However, the style is
considered too formal for TwinLlama-3.1-8B (SFT) and Llama-3.1-
8B-Instruct, with a score of 2. The judge LLM agreed with our
previous analysis and assigned a perfect score to TwinLlama-3.1-
8B-DPO’s answer for communicating “the technical concept of
algorithm bias without becoming overly formal.”
This trend is confirmed by the average scores obtained by each
model:
TwinLlama-3.1-8B - Accuracy: 2.45
TwinLlama-3.1-8B - Style: 2.04
TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO - Accuracy: 2.46
TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO - Style: 2.12
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - Accuracy: 2.62
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - Style: 1.86

## Page 510

In terms of accuracy, our two fine-tuned models get similar scores,
while Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves the highest accuracy score of
2.62. This suggests that the instruct-tuned Llama model may have a
slight edge in providing factually correct information. This is probably
due to its extensive post-training process with over 10 million
samples (compared to 13,000 in our case).
However, when it comes to style, we see a different pattern.
TwinLlama-3.1-8B-DPO leads with a score of 2.12, successfully
achieving a more accessible and less formal writing style without
sacrificing content quality. TwinLlama-3.1-8B (SFT) follows with 2.04,
showing improvement but retaining some formality, while Llama-3.1-
8B-Instruct trails with 1.86, tending toward verbosity.
Based on this feedback and the manual review of the generated
answers, we can detect mistakes and identify areas for
improvement. This is essential for refining the data generation
process through additional filtering or augmenting the dataset with
missing information. While this first version already shows promising
results, iterating over different datasets and models will allow us to
significantly outperform our baseline and create the best possible
model for our use case.
Summary

## Page 511

In this chapter, we explored LLM evaluation with models and RAG
systems. We saw how to interpret classic benchmarks like MMLU to
select strong candidates to use or fine-tune. We also detailed how
domain-specific and task-specific evaluations work, and how to
create our own based on publicly available examples.
We focused on two techniques (multiple-choice question answering
and LLM-as-a-judge) as the backbone of these custom evaluation
frameworks.
However, models are commonly integrated into broader systems that
provide additional context. We introduced two evaluation frameworks
for RAG systems, Ragas and ARES. We saw both similarities (for
example, synthetic data generation) and differences in how they
evaluate RAG systems (context-based metrics versus trained
classifiers). Finally, we evaluated TwinLlama-3.1-8B with a judge
LLM according to three criteria: relevance, coherence, and
conciseness. This provided insights into how we can improve it.
In the next chapter, we will explore inference optimization techniques
to improve speed and reduce memory usage, without significantly
compromising model performance. We will also delve into
optimization methods, model parallelism techniques and examine
different quantization approaches.

Inference Optimization
Deploying LLMs is challenging due to their significant computational
and memory requirements. Efficiently running these models
necessitates the use of specialized accelerators, such as GPUs or
TPUs, which can parallelize operations and achieve higher
throughput. While some tasks, like document generation, can be
processed in batches overnight, others require low latency and fast
generation, such as code completion. As a result, optimizing the
inference process – how these models make predictions based on
input data – is critical for many practical applications. This includes
reducing the time it takes to generate the first token (latency),
increasing the number of tokens generated per second (throughput),
and minimizing the memory footprint of LLMs.
Indeed, naive deployment approaches lead to poor hardware
utilization and underwhelming throughput and latency. Fortunately, a
variety of optimization techniques have emerged to dramatically
speed up inference. This chapter will explore key methods like
speculative decoding, model parallelism, and weight quantization,
demonstrating how thoughtful implementations can achieve
speedups of 2–4X or more. We will also introduce three popular

## Page 515

inference engines (Text Generation Inference, vLLM, and TensorRT-
LLM) and compare their features in terms of inference optimization.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
Model optimization strategies
Model parallelism
Model quantization
By the end of this chapter, you will understand the core challenges in
LLM inference and be familiar with state-of-the-art optimization
techniques, including model parallelism and weight quantization.
All the code examples from this chapter can be found
on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineering.
Model optimization strategies
Most of the LLMs used nowadays, like GPT or Llama, are powered
by a decoder-only Transformer architecture. The decoder-only
architecture is designed for text-generation tasks. It predicts the next
word in a sequence based on preceding words, making it effective
for generating contextually appropriate text continuations.

## Page 516

In contrast, an encoder-only architecture, like BERT, focuses on
understanding and representing the input text with detailed
embeddings. It excels in tasks that require comprehensive context
understanding, such as text classification and named entity
recognition. Finally, the encoder-decoder architecture, like T5,
combines both functionalities. The encoder processes the input text
to generate a context-rich representation, which the decoder then
uses to produce the output text. This dual structure is particularly
powerful for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation and
summarization, where understanding the input context and
generating a relevant output are equally important.
In this book, we only focus on the decoder-only architecture, which
dominates the LLM field.
Figure 8.1 – Inference process with decoder-only models. We
provide “I have a dream” as input and obtain “of” as output.
As shown in Figure 8.1, the basic inference process for a decoder-
only model involves:

## Page 517

1. Tokenizing the input prompt and passing it through an
embedding layer and positional encoding.
2. Computing key and value pairs for each input token using the
multi-head attention mechanism.
3. Generating output tokens sequentially, one at a time, using the
computed keys and values.
While Steps 1 and 2 are computationally expensive, they consist of
highly parallelizable matrix multiplication that can achieve high
hardware utilization on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.
The real challenge is that the token generation in Step 3 is inherently
sequential – to generate the next token, you need to have generated
all previous tokens. This leads to an iterative process where the
output sequence is grown one token at a time, failing to leverage the
parallel computing capabilities of the hardware. Addressing this
bottleneck is one of the core focuses of inference optimization.
In this section, we will detail several optimization strategies that are
commonly used to speed up inference and reduce Video Random-
Access Memory (VRAM) usage, such as implementing a (static) KV
cache, continuous batching, speculative decoding, and optimized
attention mechanisms.
KV cache

## Page 518

We saw that LLMs generate text token by token, which is slow
because each new prediction depends on the entire previous
context. For example, to predict the 100th token in a sequence, the
model needs the context of tokens 1 through 99. When predicting
the 101st token, it again needs the information from tokens 1 through
99, plus token 100. This repeated computation is particularly
inefficient.
The key-value (KV) cache addresses this issue by storing key-value
pairs produced by self-attention layers. Instead of recalculating these
pairs for each new token, the model retrieves them from the cache,
significantly speeding up the generation.
You can see an illustration of this technique in Figure 8.2:

## Page 519

Figure 8.2 – Illustration of the KV cache
When a new token is generated, only the key and value for that
single token need to be computed and added to the cache. The KV
cache is an immediate optimization that is implemented in every
popular tool and library. Some implementations maintain a separate
KV cache for each layer of the model.
The size of the KV cache scales with the number of tokens ( )
and several model dimensions, like the number of layers ( ), the

## Page 520

number of attention heads ( ), their dimension ( ), and the
precision of the parameters in bytes ( ):
For a typical 7B parameter model using 16-bit precision, this
exceeds 2 GB for high sequence lengths (higher than 2,048 tokens).
Larger models with more layers and higher embedding dimensions
will see even greater memory requirements.
Since the KV cache grows with each generation step and is
dynamic, it prevents you from taking advantage of torch.compile, a
powerful optimization tool that fuses PyTorch code into fast and
optimized kernels. The static KV cache solves this issue by pre-
allocating the KV cache size to a maximum value, which allows you
to combine it with torch.compile for up to a 4x speedup in the
forward pass.
To configure a model to use a static KV cache with the transformers
library, follow these steps:
1. We import the tokenizer and the model we want to optimize:
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoMode
model id = "google/gemma-2b-it"

## Page 521

model_id = google/gemma-2b-it
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(mod
2. To implement the static cache, we change the cache
implementation in the model’s generation config to static :
model.generation_config.cache_implementation = "
3. Now that our KV cache is static, we can compile the model using
torch.compile:
compiled_model = torch.compile(model, mode="redu
4. We tokenize an input question, “ What is 2+2? ", and store it on
a GPU if available (if not, we store it on the CPU):
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() els
inputs = tokenizer("What is 2+2?", return_tensor
5. Let’s use the generate() method to get the model’s output and
decode it with batch_decode() to print its answer:

## Page 522

outputs = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=Tru
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_speci
['What is 2+2?\n\nThe answer is 4. 2+2 = 4.']
This returns a list containing both the input and output, correctly
answering our question.
Note that the static cache doesn’t work with all
architectures. For details on which architectures are
supported, check out the transformers documentation.
Efficiently managing the KV cache is essential, as it can quickly
exhaust available GPU memory and limit the batch sizes that can be
processed. This has motivated the development of memory-efficient
attention mechanisms and other techniques, which we will cover in
the last section.
Continuous batching
Batching, or processing multiple inference requests simultaneously,
is a standard approach to achieve high throughput. Larger batch
sizes spread out the memory cost of model weights and transfer
more data to the GPU at once, better saturating its parallel compute
capacity.

## Page 523

However, decoder-only models pose a particular challenge due to
the high variability in input prompt lengths and desired output
lengths. Some requests may have short prompts and only need a
one-word answer, while others may input a lengthy context and
expect a multi-paragraph response.
With traditional batching, we would have to wait for the longest
request in a batch to complete before starting a new batch. This
leads to under-utilization as the accelerator sits partly idle waiting for
a straggling request to finish. Continuous batching, also known as
in-flight batching, aims to prevent idle time by immediately
feeding a new request into the batch as soon as one completes.
The batching process begins the same – by filling the batch with
initial requests. But as soon as a request completes its generation, it
is evicted from the batch and a new request takes its place. This
way, the accelerator is always processing a full batch, leading to
maximally efficient hardware utilization. An additional consideration
is the need to periodically pause the generation process to run prefill,
or the embedding and encoding of waiting requests. Finding the
optimal balance between generation and prefill requires some tuning
of the waiting-served ratio hyperparameter.
Continuous batching is natively implemented in most inference
frameworks, like Hugging Face’s Text Generation Inference (TGI),

## Page 524

vLLM, and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM.
Speculative decoding
Another powerful optimization technique is speculative decoding,
also called assisted generation. The key insight is that even with
continuous batching, the token-by-token generation process fails to
fully saturate the parallel processing capabilities of the accelerator.
Speculative decoding aims to use this spare compute capacity to
predict multiple tokens simultaneously, using a smaller proxy model
(see Figure 8.3).
Figure 8.3 – Illustration of traditional decoding (left) and speculative
decoding (right)
The general approach is:
Apply a smaller model, like a distilled or pruned version of the
main model, to predict multiple token completions in parallel. This
could be 5–10 tokens predicted in a single step.

## Page 525

Feed these speculative completions into the full model to validate
which predictions match what the large model would have
generated.
Retain the longest matching prefix from the speculative
completions and discard any incorrect tokens.
The result is that, if the small model approximates the large model
well, multiple tokens can be generated in a single step. This avoids
running the expensive large model for several iterations. The degree
of speedup depends on the quality of the small model’s predictions –
a 90% match could result in a 3–4X speedup.
It is crucial that both models use the same tokenizer. If this is not the
case, the tokens generated by the draft model will not align with
those produced by the large model, making them incompatible. Let’s
implement this using the transformers library. In this example, we will
use two Qwen1.5 models from Alibaba Cloud: a 1.8B version as the
main model, and a 0.5B version as the draft model. Note that, if you
have enough VRAM, you can use much larger models like 14B, 32B,
72B, or 110B as the main model.
Here, we’re limited by the VRAM of the T4 GPU in Google Colab, but
to get the maximum speedup, the assistant model should be much
smaller than the large model.

## Page 526

Here’s a step-by-step guide to implement speculative decoding:
1. We load the tokenizer and both models:
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoMode
model_id = "Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(mod
draft_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrain
2. We then tokenize the same input and store it in the accelerator, if
available:
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() els
inputs = tokenizer("What is 2+2?", return_tensor
3. We can now use model.generate() with the argument
assistant_model to enable speculative decoding:
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=Tru
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_speci
['What is 2+2? 2 + 2 equals 4!']

## Page 527

The speedup in this small example is not significant, but it is clearly
noticeable with bigger models.
Prompt lookup decoding is a variant of speculative decoding, tailored
to input-grounded tasks like summarization where there is often
overlap between the prompt and output. Shared n-grams are used
as the LLM candidate tokens. We can enable prompt lookup
decoding by using the prompt_lookup_num_tokens parameter in
model.generate() :
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, prompt_lookup_n
By combining the static KV cache with torch.compile, implementing
continuous batching, and leveraging speculative decoding
techniques, LLMs can see inference speedups of 2–4x or more with
no loss in quality.
Another approach to creating a small proxy model consists of jointly
fine-tuning a small model alongside a large model for maximum
fidelity. A representative technique here is Medusa, which inserts
dedicated speculation heads into the main model. The Medusa-1
approach fine-tunes these speculation heads while freezing the large
model, while the Medusa-2 approach jointly fine-tunes both the
speculation heads and the large model. The Medusa method has

## Page 528

demonstrated impressive results, enabling a 70M parameter model
to closely approximate the performance of a 7B parameter model on
a range of tasks. Speculative decoding is natively supported by TGI.
Optimized attention mechanisms
The Transformer architecture is based on the attention mechanism,
which scales quadratically with the number of input tokens (or
sequence length). This is particularly inefficient for longer
sequences, where the size of the KV cache can blow up.
Introduced by Kwon, Li, et al. (2023), PagedAttention addresses
these memory challenges by drawing inspiration from virtual memory
and paging in operating systems. It partitions the KV cache into
blocks, eliminating the need for contiguous memory allocation. Each
block contains the keys and values for a fixed number of tokens.
During attention computation, the PagedAttention kernel efficiently
fetches these blocks, regardless of their physical memory location.
This partitioning allows for near-optimal memory utilization. This is
useful for batching more sequences together, which increases
throughput and GPU utilization. Moreover, PagedAttention 's
block-based approach naturally supports memory sharing across
multiple output sequences generated from the same prompt. This is
particularly advantageous in parallel sampling and beam search,

## Page 529

where the same prompt is used to generate multiple outputs. The
shared memory blocks reduce redundant computations and memory
usage, cutting the memory overhead by up to 55% and improving
throughput by up to 2.2x, according to the authors. The vLLM library
received the first implementation of PagedAttention. Since then,
PagedAttention has also been implemented in TGI and TensorRT-
LLM.
Another popular option is FlashAttention-2. Developed by Tri Dao
(2023), it introduced several key innovations that are designed to
address the quadratic runtime and memory constraints in traditional
attention. By dividing input and output matrices into smaller blocks,
FlashAttention-2 ensures that these blocks can fit into the GPU’s on-
chip SRAM, which is much faster than high-bandwidth memory. This
approach significantly reduces the frequency of data transfers
between the GPU’s main memory and its processing units.
This is combined with online softmax, which computes the softmax
function independently for each block of the attention scores matrix,
rather than for the entire matrix at once. By maintaining a running
maximum and a running sum of exponentials, FlashAttention-2 can
calculate attention probabilities without needing to store large
intermediate matrices.

## Page 530

Additionally, FlashAttention-2’s online softmax computation enables
block-wise processing, maintaining accuracy while significantly
reducing memory requirements. This is particularly important for
training, where the recomputation of intermediate values (instead of
storing them) in the backward pass reduces memory usage from
quadratic to linear, in relation to sequence length.
Unlike PagedAttention, FlashAttention-2 can easily be used with the
transformers library through the attn_implementation parameter:
1. Install the flash-attn library with --no-build-isolation so
that we don’t install the dependencies:
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
2. To use FlashAttention-2 for inference, specify
flash_attention_2 in the attn_implementation parameter
when loading a model. For example, this is how to load Mistral-
7B-Instruct-v0.3 with FlashAttention-2:
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3",
attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)

## Page 531

The techniques presented in this section focused on improving the
model’s efficiency in processing tokens. In the next section, we will
discuss how to distribute our model and calculations across multiple
GPUs.
Model parallelism
Model parallelism allows you to distribute the memory and compute
requirements of LLMs across multiple GPUs. This enables the
training and inference of models too large to fit on a single device,
while also improving performance in terms of throughput (tokens per
second).
There are three main approaches to model parallelism, each
involving splitting the model weights and computation in different
ways: data parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and tensor parallelism.
Although these approaches were originally developed for training,
we can reuse them for inference by focusing on the forward pass
only.
Data parallelism
Data parallelism (DP) is the simplest type of model parallelism. It
involves making copies of the model and distributing these replicas
across different GPUs (see Figure 8.4). Each GPU processes a

## Page 532

subset of the data simultaneously. During training, the gradients
calculated on each GPU are averaged and used to update the model
parameters, ensuring that each replica remains synchronized. This
approach is particularly beneficial when the batch size is too large to
fit into a single machine or when aiming to speed up the training
process.
Figure 8.4 – Illustration of data parallelism with four GPUs
During inference, DP can be useful for processing concurrent
requests. By distributing the workload across multiple GPUs, this
approach helps reduce latency, as multiple requests can be handled
simultaneously. This concurrent processing also increases
throughput, since a higher number of requests can be processed at
the same time.

## Page 533

However, the effectiveness of DP is limited by the model size and the
communication overhead between GPUs. Indeed, replicating the
model’s parameters on each GPU is inefficient. This means that this
technique only works when the model is small enough to fit into a
single GPU, leaving less room for input data and thus limiting the
batch size. For larger models or when memory is a constraint, this
can be a significant drawback.
Typically, DP is mainly used for training, while pipeline and tensor
parallelism are preferred for inference.
Pipeline parallelism
Introduced by Huang et al. in the GPipe paper (2019), pipeline
parallelism (PP) is a strategy for distributing the computational load
of training and running large neural networks across multiple GPUs.
Unlike traditional DP, which replicates the entire model on each
GPU, pipeline parallelism partitions the model’s layers across
different GPUs. This approach allows each GPU to handle a specific
portion of the model, thereby reducing the memory burden on
individual GPUs.

## Page 534

Figure 8.5 – Illustration of pipeline parallelism with four GPUs
As shown in Figure 8.5, in a typical four-way pipeline parallel split,
the model is divided into four segments, with each segment assigned
to a different GPU. The first 25% of the model’s layers might be
processed by GPU 1, the next 25% by GPU 2, and so on. During the
forward pass, activations are computed and then passed along to
the next GPU. For training, the backward pass follows a similar
sequence in reverse, with gradients being propagated back through
the GPUs. The number of GPUs is often referred to as the degree of
parallelism.
The primary advantage of pipeline parallelism is its ability to
significantly reduce the memory requirements per GPU. However,
this approach introduces new challenges, particularly related to the
sequential nature of the pipeline. One of the main issues is the
occurrence of “pipeline bubbles.” These bubbles arise when some

## Page 535

GPUs are idle, waiting for activations from preceding layers. This idle
time can reduce the overall efficiency of the process.
Micro-batching was developed to mitigate the impact of pipeline
bubbles. By splitting the input batch into smaller sub-batches, micro-
batching ensures that GPUs remain busier, as the next sub-batch
can begin processing before the previous one is fully completed.
Figure 8.6 – Illustration of pipeline parallelism with micro-batching.
Figure 8.6 shows an example of pipeline parallelism with micro-
batching. In this example, the pipeline has four stages (F0, F1, F2,
F3), and the input batch is divided into four micro-batches. GPU 0
will process forward paths F0,0, F0,1, F0,2, and F0,3, sequentially.
Once F0,0 is complete, GPU 1 can immediately start processing
F1,0 and so on. After completing these forward passes, GPU 0 waits
for the other GPUs to finish their respective forward computations
before starting the backward paths (B0,3, B0,2, B0,1, and B0,0).

## Page 536

Pipeline parallelism is implemented in distributed training
frameworks like Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed (ZeRO), and PyTorch
through the dedicated Pipeline Parallelism for PyTorch (PiPPy)
library. At the time of writing, only certain inference frameworks like
TensorRT-LLM support pipeline parallelism.
Tensor parallelism
Introduced by Shoeby, Patwary, Puri et al. in the Megatron-LM paper
(2019), tensor parallelism (TP) is another popular technique to
distribute the computation of LLM layers across multiple devices. In
contrast to pipeline parallelism, TP splits the weight matrices found in
individual layers. This enables simultaneous computations,
significantly reducing memory bottlenecks and increasing processing
speed.
In TP, large matrices, such as the weight matrices in MLPs or the
attention heads in self-attention layers, are partitioned across several
GPUs. Each GPU holds a portion of these matrices and performs
computations on its respective slice.

## Page 537

Figure 8.7 – Illustration of column-wise tensor parallelism in an MLP
layer (W)
For instance, in an MLP layer, the weight matrix is divided so that
each GPU processes only a subset of the weights (see Figure 8.7).
The inputs are broadcast to all GPUs, which then independently
compute their respective outputs. The partial results are then
aggregated through an all-reduce operation, combining them to form
the final output.
In the context of self-attention layers, TP is particularly efficient due
to the inherent parallelism of attention heads. Each GPU can

## Page 538

compute a subset of these heads independently, allowing the model
to process large sequences more effectively. This makes TP more
efficient than pipeline parallelism, which requires waiting for the
completion of previous layers.
Despite its advantages, TP is not universally applicable to all layers
of a neural network. Layers like LayerNorm and Dropout, which have
dependencies spanning the entire input, cannot be efficiently
partitioned and are typically replicated across devices instead.
However, these operations can be split on the sequence dimension
of the input instead (sequence parallelism). Different GPUs can
compute these layers on different slices of the input sequence,
avoiding replication of weights. This technique is limited to a few
specific layers, but it can provide additional memory savings,
especially for very large input sequence lengths.
Moreover, TP necessitates high-speed interconnects between
devices to minimize communication overhead, making it impractical
to implement across nodes with insufficient interconnect bandwidth.
TP is also implemented in distributed training frameworks like
Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed (ZeRO), and PyTorch (FSDP). It is
available in most inference frameworks, like TGI, vLLM, and
TensorRT-LLM.

## Page 539

Combining approaches
Data, tensor, and pipeline parallelisms are orthogonal techniques
that can be combined. Figure 8.8 illustrates how a given model can
be split according to each approach:
Figure 8.8 – Illustration of the different model parallelism techniques
Combining these techniques can mitigate their respective issues.
Pipeline parallelism provides the greatest memory reduction but
sacrifices efficiency, due to pipeline bubbles. This may be ideal if the
primary constraint fits the model in the GPU memory. In contrast, if
low latency is paramount, then prioritizing tensor parallelism and
accepting a larger memory footprint may be the better trade-off. In
practice, a model may be split depth-wise into a few pipeline stages,
with tensor parallelism used within each stage.
Balancing these tradeoffs and mapping a given model architecture
onto available hardware accelerators is a key challenge in deploying

## Page 540

LLMs.
Model quantization
Quantization refers to the process of representing the weights and
activations of a neural network using lower-precision data types. In
the context of LLMs, quantization primarily focuses on reducing the
precision of the model’s weights and activations.
By default, weights are typically stored in a 16-bit or 32-bit floating-
point format (FP16 or FP32), which provides high precision but
comes at the cost of increased memory usage and computational
complexity. Quantization is a solution to reduce the memory footprint
and accelerate the inference of LLMs.
In addition to these benefits, larger models with over 30 billion
parameters can outperform smaller models (7B–13B LLMs) in terms
of quality when quantized to 2- or 3-bit precision. This means they
can achieve superior performance while maintaining a comparable
memory footprint.
In this section, we will introduce the concepts of quantization, GGUF
with llama.cpp , GPTQ, and EXL2, along with an overview of
additional techniques. In addition to the code provided in this section,
you can refer to AutoQuant (bit.ly/autoquant) to quantize their
models using a Google Colab notebook.

## Page 541

Introduction to quantization
There are two main approaches to weight quantization: Post-
Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT). PTQ is a straightforward technique where the weights of a
pre-trained model are directly converted to a lower precision format
without any retraining. While PTQ is easy to implement, it may result
in some performance degradation. Conversely, QAT performs
quantization during the training or fine-tuning stage, allowing the
model to adapt to the lower precision weights. QAT often yields
better performance compared to PTQ but requires additional
computational resources and representative training data.
The choice of data type plays a crucial role in quantization. Floating-
point numbers, such as FP32, FP16 (half-precision), and BF16
(brain floating-point), are commonly used in deep learning. These
formats allocate a fixed number of bits to represent the sign ,
exponent , and significand (mantissa) of a number.

## Page 542

Figure 8.9 – Comparison the between FP32, FP16, and BF16
formats
A sign of 0 represents a positive number, while 1 indicates a
negative number. Conversely, the exponent controls the range that is
represented (big or small). Finally, the significand controls the
precision of the number (the number of digits). The formula used to
convert these representations into real numbers is:
The data types shown in Figure 7.7 display different tradeoffs, as
illustrated with different representations of ( ). FP32
uses 32 bits, providing high precision but also requiring more

## Page 543

memory. Conversely, FP16 and BF16 use 16 bits, lowering the
memory footprint at the cost of a lower precision. In general, neural
networks prefer a bigger range than better precision, which is why
BF16 is the most popular data type when the hardware supports it.
For example, NVIDIA’s Ampere architecture (A100, A30, etc.)
supports BF16, but previous generations like Turing (T4, T40, etc.)
do not.
However, we are not restricted to these three data types. Lower-
precision data types, such as INT8 (8-bit integers), can be employed
for quantization, further reducing the memory footprint. Naïve
quantization techniques, such as absolute maximum (absmax)
quantization and zero-point quantization, can be applied to convert
FP32 , FP16 , or BF16 weights to INT8 , as illustrated in Figure
8.10:

## Page 544

Figure 8.10 – Quantization of 0.1 in a [-3.0, 3.2] range with absmax
quantization and zero-point quantization
Absmax quantization maps the original weights to the range [-127,
127] by dividing them by the absolute maximum value of and
scaling them:
For example, if our absolute maximum value is 3.2 (see Figure 8.8),
a weight of 0.1 would be quantized to . To dequantize it,
we do the inverse operation:
This means that if we dequantize our weight, we obtain .
We can see a rounding error of in this example. In Python, we
can implement it as follows with the PyTorch library:
import torch
def absmax_quantize(X):
# Calculate scale
scale = 127 / torch.max(torch.abs(X))
# Quantize
X_quant = (scale * X).round()
return X_quant.to(torch.int8)

## Page 545

Zero-point quantization, on the other hand, considers asymmetric
input distributions and maps the weights to the range [-128, 127] by
introducing a zero-point offset:
Where and .
If we take the same example with a weight of 0.1, we get a scale of
and a zero-point value of . The
weight of 0.1 would be quantized to , unlike the
value of provided by absmax.
We can easily get the dequantization by applying the inverse
operation:
In Python, zero-point quantization can be implemented as follows:
def zeropoint_quantize(X):
# Calculate value range (denominator)
x_range = torch.max(X) - torch.min(X)
x_range = 1 if x_range == 0 else x_range
# Calculate scale

## Page 546

# Calculate scale
scale = 255 / x_range
# Shift by zero-point
zeropoint = (-scale * torch.min(X) - 128).roun
# Scale and round the inputs
X_quant = torch.clip((X * scale + zeropoint).r
return X_quant.to(torch.int8)
However, naïve quantization methods have limitations, particularly
when dealing with outlier features in LLMs. Outlier features are
extreme weight values (about 0.1% of total values) that can
significantly impact the quantization process, leading to reduced
precision for other values.
Discarding these outliers is not feasible, as it would degrade a
model’s performance. You can see an example of outliers in Figure
8.11:

## Page 547

Figure 8.11 – Example of outliers in a weight matrix
To address the outlier problem, more advanced quantization
techniques have been proposed. One notable example is
LLM.int8() , introduced by Dettmers et al. (2022). LLM.int8()
employs a mixed-precision quantization scheme, where outlier
features are processed using FP16, while the remaining values are
quantized to INT8. This approach effectively reduces the memory
footprint of LLMs by nearly 2x while minimizing performance
degradation.
LLM.int8() works by performing matrix multiplication in three
steps. First, it extracts columns containing outlier features from the
input hidden states using a custom threshold. Second, it performs
separate matrix multiplications for the outliers (in FP16 ) and non-
outliers (in INT8 ) using vector-wise quantization. Finally, it
dequantizes the non-outlier results and combines them with the
outlier results to obtain the final output in FP16.
The effectiveness of LLM.int8() has been demonstrated
empirically, showing negligible performance degradation (<1%)
compared to the original FP32 models. However, it does introduce
an additional computational overhead, resulting in around 20%
slower inference for large models. Models can be directly loaded in

## Page 548

8-bit precision with the transformer library, using LLM.int8() , as
follows:
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model
Introduced by Dettmers et al. (2023), NF4 is a 4-bit precision format
designed for QLoRA (discussed in Chapter 5). It is also integrated
into the transformers library but requires the bitsandbytes library as a
dependency. To load a model in NF4 (4-bit precision), you can use
the load_in_4bit parameter, as follows:
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model
Quantization with GGUF and llama.cpp
The llama.cpp project is an open-source C++ software library
created by Georgi Gerganov, designed to perform inference with
various LLMs. It is the most popular quantization technique, with
many quantized models available on the Hugging Face Hub.

## Page 549

Compared to other libraries that rely on hardware-specific closed-
source libraries like CUDA, llama.cpp can run on a broader range of
hardware. It has gained significant popularity, particularly among
users without specialized hardware, as it can operate on CPUs and
Android devices. Moreover, llama.cpp can also offload layers to the
GPU, accelerating inference speed. It is compatible with different
inference optimization techniques, such as FlashAttention-2 and
speculative decoding.
This project features its own quantization format, GGUF, designed to
simplify and speed up model loading. GGUF files store tensors and
metadata, supporting various formats, from 1-bit to 8-bit precision. It
follows a naming convention based on the number of bits used and
specific variants, such as:
IQ1_S and IQ1_M : 1-bit precision – very low quality
IQ2_XXS/XS/S/M and Q2_K : 2-bit precision – generally low
quality but IQ2 can be usable for large models
IQ3_XXS/XS/S/M and Q3_K_S/M/L : 3-bit precision – low quality
but usable for large models
IQ4_XS/NL and Q4_K_S/M, Q4_0/1 : 4-bit precision – good
quality and usable for most models
Q5_K_S/M and Q5_0/1 : 5-bit precision – high quality
Q6_K : 6-bit precision –very high quality
Q8_0 : 8-bit precision – highest quality

## Page 550

To provide a brief overview of GGUF quantization, llama.cpp groups
values into blocks and rounds them to a lower precision. For
instance, the legacy Q4_0 format handles 32 values per block,
scaling and quantizing them based on the largest weight value in the
block ( ). In Q4_1, the smallest Lvalue in the block
is also added ( ). In Q4_K, weights
are divided into super-blocks, containing 8 blocks with 32 values.
Block scales and minimum values are also quantized in higher
precision with 6 bits ( ). Finally,
i-quants like IQ4_XS are inspired by another quantization technique
called QuIP#. This ensures an even number of positive (or negative)
quant signs in groups of eight and implements the lattice to store
their magnitude.
Here is a practical example of how to quantize a model in the GGUF
format. The following steps can be executed on a free T4 GPU in
Google Colab:
1. Install llama.cpp and the required libraries:
!git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cp
!cd llama.cpp && git pull && make clean && LLAMA
!pip install -r llama.cpp/requirements.txt

## Page 551

2. Download the model to convert. We will provide the model ID from
the Hugging Face Hub – for example, mistralai/Mistral-7B-
Instruct-v0.2 :
MODEL_ID = "mlabonne/EvolCodeLlama-7b"
MODEL_NAME = MODEL_ID.split('/')[-1]
!git lfs install
!git clone https://huggingface.co/{MODEL_ID}
3. First, we convert the model into FP16. This is an intermediary
artifact that will be used for every GGUF quantization type. Note
that different conversion scripts exist in llama.cpp and are
compatible with different models:
fp16 = f"{MODEL_NAME}/{MODEL_NAME.lower()}.fp16
!python llama.cpp/convert.py {MODEL_NAME} --outt
4. We select a format (here, Q4_K_M ) and start the quantization.
This process can take an hour on a T4 GPU:
METHOD = "q4_k_m"
qtype = f"{MODEL_NAME}/{MODEL_NAME.lower()}.{met
!./llama.cpp/quantize {fp16} {qtype} {METHOD}

## Page 552

5. Once it’s done, your quantized model is ready. You can download
it locally, or upload it to the Hugging Face Hub using the following
code:
from huggingface_hub import create_repo, HfApi
hf_token = "" # Specify your token
username = "" # Specify your username
api = HfApi()
# Create empty repo
create_repo(
repo_id = f"{username}/{MODEL_NAME}-GGUF",
repo_type="model",
exist_ok=True,
token=hf_token
)
# Upload gguf files
api.upload_folder(
folder_path=MODEL_NAME,
repo_id=f"{username}/{MODEL_NAME}-GGUF",
allow_patterns=f"*.gguf",
token=hf_token
)
GGUF models can be used with backends such as llama-cpp-python
and frameworks like LangChain. This is useful if you want to
integrate a quantized model into a broader system. You can also
directly chat with the model using frontends, like llama.cpp’s

## Page 553

lightweight server, LM Studio, and the Text Generation Web UI.
These tools enable easy interaction with the GGUF models,
providing an experience similar to ChatGPT.
Quantization with GPTQ and EXL2
While GGUF and llama.cpp offer CPU inference with GPU
offloading, GPTQ and EXL2 are two quantization formats dedicated
to GPUs. This makes them both faster than llama.cpp during
inference. In particular, EXL2 offers the highest throughput with its
dedicated library, ExLlamaV2.
GPTQ and EXL2 quants are based on the GPTQ algorithm,
introduced by Frantar et al. (2023). It optimizes weight quantization
for LLMs by refining the Optimal Brain Quantization (OBQ)
approach to handle extensive matrices efficiently. It begins with a
Cholesky decomposition of the Hessian inverse, ensuring numerical
stability. Instead of quantizing weights in a strict order, GPTQ
processes them in batches, updating columns and associated blocks
iteratively. This method leverages lazy batch updates, reducing
computational redundancy and memory bottlenecks.
While GPTQ is limited to 4-bit precision, EXL2 offers more flexibility
with a highly customizable precision that can mix different
quantization levels. This allows for precise bitrates between 2 and 8

## Page 554

bits per weight, such as 2.3 , 3.5 , or 6.0 . It can also apply
multiple quantization levels to each linear layer, prioritizing more
important weights with higher bit quantization. Parameters are
selected automatically, by quantizing each matrix multiple times and
choosing a combination that minimizes the quantization error while
meeting a target bitrate. In practice, this allows 70B models to run on
a single 24 GB GPU with 2.55-bit precision.
The inference itself is handled by the ExLlamaV2 library, which
supports both the GPTQ and EXL2 models.
In the following example, let’s quantize a model in the EXL2 format
using ExLlamaV2. These steps can be executed on a free T4 GPU
in Google Colab:
1. Install the ExLlamaV2 library from source:
!git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav
!pip install -e exllamav2
2. We download the model to quantize by cloning its repo from the
Hugging Face Hub:
MODEL_ID = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
MODEL_NAME = MODEL_ID.split('/')[-1]

## Page 555

!git lfs install
!git clone https://huggingface.co/{MODEL_ID}
3. Download the calibration dataset used to measure the
quantization error. In this case, we will use WikiText-103, a
standard calibration dataset with high-quality articles from
Wikipedia:
!wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext/r
4. Quantize the model at a given precision (for example, 4.5):
!mkdir quant
!python exllamav2/convert.py \
-i {MODEL_NAME} \
-o quant \
-c wikitext-test.parquet \
-b 4.5
The quantized model can then be uploaded to the Hugging Face
Hub, as seen previously.
GPTQ and EXL2 quants are not as widely supported as GGUF. For
example, frontends like LM Studio do not currently integrate them.
You can use other tools instead, like oobabooga’s Text Generation

## Page 556

Web UI. It is also directly integrated into the transformers library and
supported by TGI. GPTQ models are also supported in TensorRT-
LLM.
While less popular than GGUF, you can find a lot of GPTQ and EXL2
models on the Hugging Face Hub.
Other quantization techniques
There is a variety of quantization techniques beyond GGUF, GPTQ,
and EXL2. This subsection will briefly introduce Activate-aware
Weight Quantization (AWQ) as well as extreme quantization
techniques, like QuIP# (Quantization with Incoherence Processing)
and HQQ (Half-Quadratic Quantization).
Introduced by Lin et al. (2023), AWQ is another popular quantization
algorithm. It identifies and protects the most important weights,
which are determined based on activation magnitude instead of
weight magnitude. This approach involves applying optimal per-
channel scaling to these salient weights, without relying on
backpropagation or reconstruction, ensuring that the LLM does not
overfit the calibration set. While it relies on a different paradigm,
AWQ is quite close to the GPTQ and EXL2 versions, although
slightly slower. They are well-supported by inference engines and
integrated into TGI, vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM.

## Page 557

An interesting trend is the quantization of models into 1- or 2-bit
precision. While some formats, like EXL2, allow extreme
quantization, the quality of the models often suffers significantly.
However, recent algorithms like QuIP# and HQQ have targeted this
regime and offer quantization methods that better preserve the
performance of the original models. This is particularly true for large
models (over 30B parameters), which can end up taking less space
than 7B or 13B parameter models while providing higher-quality
outputs.
This trend is expected to continue, further optimizing these
quantization methods.

Summary
In summary, inference optimization is a critical aspect of deploying
LLMs effectively. This chapter explored various optimization
techniques, including optimized generation methods, model
parallelism, and weight quantization. Significant speedups can be
achieved by leveraging techniques like predicting multiple tokens in
parallel with speculative decoding, or using an optimized attention
mechanism with FlashAttention-2. Additionally, we discussed how
model parallelism methods, including data, pipeline, and tensor
parallelism, distribute the computational load across multiple GPUs

## Page 559

to increase throughput and reduce latency. Weight quantization, with
formats like GGUF and EXL2, further reduces the memory footprint
and accelerates inference, with some calculated tradeoff in output
quality.
Understanding and applying these optimization strategies are
essential for achieving high performance in practical applications of
LLMs, such as chatbots and code completion. The choice of
techniques and tools depends on specific requirements, including
available hardware, desired latency, and throughput. By combining
various approaches, such as continuous batching and speculative
decoding, along with advanced attention mechanisms and model
parallelism, users can tailor their deployment strategies to maximize
efficiency.
Way back in Chapter 4, we focused only on implementing the
ingestion pipeline, which is just one component of a standard RAG
application. In the next chapter, we will conclude the RAG system by
implementing the retrieval and generation components and
integrating them into the inference pipeline.

RAG Inference Pipeline
Back in Chapter 4, we implemented the retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) feature pipeline to populate the vector database
(DB). Within the feature pipeline, we gathered data from the data
warehouse, cleaned, chunked, and embedded the documents, and,
ultimately, loaded them to the vector DB. Thus, at this point, the
vector DB is filled with documents and ready to be used for RAG.
Based on the RAG methodology, you can split your software
architecture into three modules: one for retrieval, one to augment the
prompt, and one to generate the answer. We will follow a similar
pattern by implementing a retrieval module to query the vector DB.
Within this module, we will implement advanced RAG techniques to
optimize the search. Afterward, we won’t dedicate a whole module to
augmenting the prompt, as that would be overengineering, which we
try to avoid. However, we will write an inference service that inputs
the user query and context, builds the prompt, and calls the LLM to
generate the answer. To summarize, we will implement two core
Python modules, one for retrieval and one for calling the LLM using
the user’s input and context as input. When we glue these together,
we will have an end-to-end RAG flow.

## Page 564

In Chapters 5 and 6, we fine-tuned our LLM Twin model, and in
Chapter 8, we learned how to optimize it for inference. Thus, at this
point, the LLM is ready for production. What is left is to build and
deploy the two modules described above.
We will dedicate the next chapter entirely to deploying our fine-tuned
LLM Twin model to AWS SageMaker, as an AWS SageMaker
inference endpoint. Thus, the focus of this chapter is to dig into the
advanced RAG retrieval module implementation. We have dedicated
a whole chapter to the retrieval step because this is where the magic
happens in an RAG system. At the retrieval step (and not when
calling the LLM), you write most of the RAG inference code. This
step is where you have to wrangle your data to ensure that you
retrieve the most relevant data points from the vector DB. Hence,
most of the advanced RAG logic goes within the retrieval step.
To sum up, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
Understanding the LLM Twin’s RAG inference pipeline
Exploring the LLM Twin’s advanced RAG techniques
Implementing the LLM Twin’s RAG inference pipeline
By the end of this chapter, you will know how to implement an
advanced RAG retrieval module, augment a prompt using the
retrieved context, and call an LLM to generate the final answer.

## Page 565

Ultimately, you will know how to build a production-ready RAG
inference pipeline end to end.
Understanding the LLM Twin’s RAG
inference pipeline
Before implementing the RAG inference pipeline, we want to discuss
its software architecture and advanced RAG techniques. Figure 9.1
illustrates an overview of the RAG inference flow. The inference
pipeline starts with the input query, retrieves the context using the
retrieval module (based on the query), and calls the LLM SageMaker
service to generate the final answer.

## Page 566

Figure 9.1: RAG inference pipeline architecture
The feature pipeline and the retrieval module, defined in Figure 9.1,
are independent processes. The feature pipeline runs on a different
machine on a schedule to populate the vector DB. At the same time,

## Page 567

the retrieval module is called on demand, within the inference
pipeline, on every user request.
By separating concerns between the two components, the vector DB
is always populated with the latest data, ensuring feature freshness,
while the retrieval module can access the latest features on every
request. The input of the RAG retrieval module is the user’s query,
based on which we have to return the most relevant and similar data
points from the vector DB, which will be used to guide the LLM in
generating the final answer.
To fully understand the dynamics of the RAG inference pipeline, let’s
go through the architecture flow from Figure 9.1 step by step:
1. User query: We begin with the user who makes a query, such as
“Write an article about...”
2. Query expansion: We expand the initial query to generate
multiple queries that reflect different aspects or interpretations of
the original user query. Thus, instead of one query, we will use xN
queries. By diversifying the search terms, the retrieval module
increases the likelihood of capturing a comprehensive set of
relevant data points. This step is crucial when the original query is
too narrow or vague.
3. Self-querying: We extract useful metadata from the original
query, such as the author’s name. The extracted metadata will be

## Page 568

used as filters for the vector search operation, eliminating
redundant data points from the query vector space (making the
search more accurate and faster).
4. Filtered vector search: We embed each query and perform a
similarity search to find each search’s top K data points. We
execute xN searches corresponding to the number of expanded
queries. We call this step a filtered vector search as we leverage
the metadata extracted from the self-query step as query filters.
5. Collecting results: We get up to xK results closest to its specific
expanded query interpretation for each search operation. Further,
we aggregate the results of all the xN searches, ending up with a
list of N x K results containing a mix of articles, posts, and
repositories chunks. The results include a broader set of
potentially relevant chunks, offering multiple relevant angles
based on the original query’s different facets.
6. Reranking: To keep only the top K most relevant results from the
list of N x K potential items, we must filter the list further. We will
use a reranking algorithm that scores each chunk based on the
relevance and importance relative to the initial user query. We will
leverage a neural cross-encoder model to compute the score, a
value between 0 and 1, where 1 means the result is entirely
relevant to the query. Ultimately, we sort the N x K results based
on the score and pick the top K items. Thus, the output is a

## Page 569

ranked list of K chunks, with the most relevant data points situated
at the top.
7. Build the prompt and call the LLM: We map the final list of the
most relevant K chunks to a string used to build the final prompt.
We create the prompt using a prompt template, the retrieved
context, and the user’s query. Ultimately, the augmented prompt is
sent to the LLM (hosted on AWS SageMaker exposed as an API
endpoint).
8. Answer: We are waiting for the answer to be generated. After the
LLM processes the prompt, the RAG logic finishes by sending the
generated response to the user.
That wraps up the overview of the RAG inference pipeline. Now, let’s
dig deeper into the details.
Exploring the LLM Twin’s advanced
RAG techniques
Now that we understand the overall flow of our RAG inference
pipeline, let’s explore the advanced RAG techniques we used in our
retrieval module:
Pre-retrieval step: Query expansion and self-querying
Retrieval step: Filtered vector search
Post-retrieval step: Reranking

## Page 570

Before digging into each method individually, let’s lay down the
Python interfaces we will use in this section, which are available at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/rag/base
.py.
The first is a prompt template factory that standardizes how we
instantiate prompt templates. As an interface, it inherits from ABC
and exposes the create_template() method, which returns a
LangChain PromptTemplate instance. Even if we avoid being
heavily reliant on LangChain, as we want to implement everything
ourselves to understand the engineering behind the scenes, some
objects, such as the PromptTemplate class, are helpful to speed
up the development without hiding too much functionality:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from pydantic import BaseModel
class PromptTemplateFactory(ABC, BaseModel):
@abstractmethod
def create_template(self) -> PromptTemplate:
pass
We also want to define a RAGStep interface used to standardize the
interface of advanced RAG steps such as query expansion and self-

## Page 571

querying. As these steps are often dependent on other LLMs, it has
a mock attribute to reduce costs and debugging time during
development:
from typing import Any
from llm_engineering.domain.queries import Query
class RAGStep(ABC):
def __init__(self, mock: bool = False) -> None
self._mock = mock
@abstractmethod
def generate(self, query: Query, *args, **kwar
pass
Ultimately, we must understand how we modeled the Query domain
entity to wrap the user’s input with other metadata required for
advanced RAG. Thus, let’s look at its implementation. First, we
import the necessary classes:
from pydantic import UUID4, Field
from llm_engineering.domain.base import VectorBase
from llm_engineering.domain.types import DataCateg
Next, we define the Query entity class, which inherits from the
VectorBaseDocument object-vector mapping (OVM) class,

## Page 572

discussed in Chapter 4. Thus, each query can easily be saved or
retrieved from the vector DB:
class Query(VectorBaseDocument):
content: str
author_id: UUID4 | None = None
author_full_name: str | None = None
metadata: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)
class Config:
category = DataCategory.QUERIES
What is essential to notice are the class’s attributes used to combine
the user’s query with a bunch of metadata fields:
content : A string containing input query.
author_id : An optional UUID4 identifier extracted from the
query used as a filter within the vector search operation to retrieve
chunks written only by a specific author
author_full_name : An optional string used to query the
author_id
metadata : A dictionary for any additional metadata, initialized as
an empty dict by default
Besides the standard definition of a domain class, we also define a
from_str() class method to create a Query instance directly from
a string. This allows us to standardize how we clean the query string

## Page 573

before constructing the query object, such as stripping any leading
or trailing whitespace and newline characters:
@classmethod
def from_str(cls, query: str) -> "Query":
return Query(content=query.strip("\n "))
Additionally, there’s an instance method called
replace_content() used to create a new Query instance with
updated content while retaining the original query’s id ,
author_id , author_full_name , and metadata :
def replace_content(self, new_content: str) ->
return Query(
id=self.id,
content=new_content,
author_id=self.author_id,
author_full_name=self.author_full_name
metadata=self.metadata,
)
This can be particularly useful when modifying the query text, for
example, during preprocessing or normalization, without losing the
associated metadata or identifiers. Following the Query class, we
define the EmbeddedQuery class:

## Page 574

class EmbeddedQuery(Query):
embedding: list[float]
class Config:
category = DataCategory.QUERIES
The EmbeddedQuery class extends Query by adding the
embedding field. The EmbeddedQuery entity encapsulates all the
data and metadata necessary to perform vector search operations
on top of Qdrant (or another vector DB).
Now that we understand all the interfaces and new domain entities
used within the RAG inference pipeline, let’s move on to our
advanced RAG pre-retrieval optimization techniques.
Advanced RAG pre-retrieval optimizations: query
expansion and self-querying
We implemented two methods to optimize the pre-retrieval
optimization step: query expansion and self-querying. The two
methods work closely with the filtered vector search step, which we
will touch on in the next section. For now, however, we will start with
understanding the code for query expansion and move to
implementing self-querying.

## Page 575

Within these two methods, we will leverage OpenAI’s API to
generate variations of the original query within the query expansion
step and to extract the necessary metadata within the self-querying
algorithm. When we wrote this book, we used GPT-4o-mini in all
our examples, but as OpenAI’s models quickly evolve, the model
might get deprecated. But that’s not an issue, as you can quickly
change it in your .env file by configuring the OPENAI_MODEL_ID
environment variable.
Query expansion
The problem in a typical retrieval step is that you query your vector
DB using a single vector representation of your original question.
This approach covers only a small area of the embedding space,
which can be limiting. If the embedding doesn’t contain all the
required information or nuances of your query, the retrieved context
may not be relevant. This means essential documents that are
semantically related but not near the query vector might be
overlooked.
The solution is based on query expansion, which offers a way to
overcome this limitation. Using an LLM to generate multiple queries
based on your initial question, you create various perspectives that
capture different facets of your query. These expanded queries,
when embedded, target other areas of the embedding space that are

## Page 576

still relevant to your original question. This increases the likelihood of
retrieving more relevant documents from the vector DB.
Implementing query expansion can be as straightforward as crafting
a detailed zero-shot prompt to guide the LLM in generating these
alternative queries. Thus, after implementing query expansion,
instead of having only one query to search relevant context, you will
have xN queries, hence xN searches.
Increasing the number of searches can impact your latency. Thus,
you must experiment with the number of queries you generate to
ensure the retrieval step meets your application requirements. You
can also optimize the searches by parallelizing them, drastically
reducing the latency, which we will do in the ContextRetriever
class implemented at the end of this chapter.
Query expansion is also known as multi-query, but the
principles are the same. For example, this is an
example of LangChain’s implementation called
MultiQueryRetriver :
https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/Mul
tiQueryRetriever/
Now, let’s dig into the code. We begin by importing the necessary
modules and classes required for query expansion:

## Page 577

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from llm_engineering.domain.queries import Query
from llm_engineering.settings import settings
from .base import RAGStep
from .prompt_templates import QueryExpansionTempla
Next, we define the QueryExpansion class, which generates
expanded query versions. The class implementation can be found at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/rag/quer
y_expanison.py:
class QueryExpansion(RAGStep):
def generate(self, query: Query, expand_to_n:
assert expand_to_n > 0, f"'expand_to_n' sh
if self._mock:
return [query for _ in range(expand_to
In the generate method, we first ensure that the number of
expansions requested ( expand_to_n ) is greater than zero. If the
instance is in mock mode ( self._mock is True ), it simply returns
a list containing copies of the original query to simulate expansion
without actually calling the API. If not in mock mode, we proceed to
create the prompt and initialize the language model:

## Page 578

query_expansion_template = QueryExpansionT
prompt = query_expansion_template.create_t
model = ChatOpenAI(model=settings.OPENAI_M
Here, we instantiate QueryExpansionTemplate and create a
prompt tailored to generate expand_to_n - 1 new queries
(excluding the original). We initialize the ChatOpenAI model with
the specified settings and set the temperature to 0 for deterministic
output. We then create a LangChain chain by combining the prompt
with the model and invoke it with the user’s question:
chain = prompt | model
response = chain.invoke({"question": query
result = response.content
By piping the prompt into the model ( prompt | model ), we set up
a chain that generates expanded queries when invoked with the
original query. The response from the model is captured in the
result object. After receiving the response, we parse and clean
the expanded queries:
queries_content = result.strip().split(que
queries = [query]
queries += [

## Page 579

queries += [
query.replace_content(stripped_content
for content in queries_content
if (stripped_content := content.strip(
]
return queries
We split the result using the separator defined in the template to get
individual queries. Starting with a list containing the original query,
we append each expanded query after stripping any extra
whitespace.
Finally, we define the QueryExpansionTemplate class, which
constructs the prompt used for query expansion. The class and other
prompt templates can be accessed at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/rag/prom
pt_templates.py:
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from .base import PromptTemplateFactory
class QueryExpansionTemplate(PromptTemplateFactory
prompt: str = """You are an AI language model

@property
def separator(self) -> str:
return "#next-question#"
def create_template(self, expand_to_n: int) ->
return PromptTemplate(
template=self.prompt,
input_variables=["question"],
partial_variables={
"separator": self.separator,
"expand_to_n": expand_to_n,
},
)
This class defines a prompt instructing the language model to
generate multiple versions of the user’s question. It uses
placeholders like {expand_to_n} , {separator} , and
{question} to customize the prompt.
It takes expand_to_n as an input parameter to define how many
queries we wish to generate while we build the PromptTemplate
instance. The separator property provides a unique string to split the
generated queries. The expand_to_n and separator variables
are passed as partial_variables , making them immutable at

## Page 581

runtime. Meanwhile, the {question} placeholder will be changed
every time the LLM chain is called.
Now that we have finished studying the query expansion
implementation, let’s look at an example of how to use the
QueryExpansion class. Let’s run the following code using this
python -m
llm_engineering.application.rag.query_expansion
command:
query = Query.from_str("Write an article about the
query_expander = QueryExpansion()
expanded_queries = query_expander.generate(que
for expanded_query in expanded_queries:
logger.info(expanded_query.content)
We get the following variations of the original query. As you can
observe, the query expansion method was successful in providing
more details and different perspectives of the initial query, such as
highlighting the effectiveness of advanced RAG methods or the
overview of these methods (remember that the first query is the
original one):

## Page 582

2024-09-18 17:51:33.529 | INFO - Can you provide
Now, let’s move to the next pre-retrieval optimization method: self-
querying.
Self-querying
The problem when embedding your query into a vector space is that
you cannot guarantee that all the aspects required by your use case
are present with enough signal in the embedding vector. For
example, you want to be 100% sure that your retrieval depends on
the tags provided in the user’s input. Unfortunately, you can’t control
the signal left within the embedding that emphasizes the tag. By
embedding the query prompt alone, you can never be sure that the
tags are sufficiently represented in the embedding vector or have
enough signal when computing the distance against other vectors.
This problem stands for any other metadata you want to present
during the search, such as IDs, names, or categories.
The solution is to use self-querying to extract the tags or other critical
metadata within the query and use them alongside the vector search
as filters. Self-querying uses an LLM to extract various metadata

## Page 583

fields crucial for your business use case, such as tags, IDs, number
of comments, likes, shares, etc. Afterward, you have complete
control over how the extracted metadata is considered during
retrieval. In our LLM Twin use case, we extract the author’s name
and use it as a filter. Self-queries work hand-in-hand with filtered
vector searches, which we will explain in the next section.
Now, let’s move on to the code. We begin by importing the
necessary modules and classes on which our code relies:
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from llm_engineering.application import utils
from llm_engineering.domain.documents import UserD
from llm_engineering.domain.queries import Query
from llm_engineering.settings import settings
from .base import RAGStep
from .prompt_templates import SelfQueryTemplate
Next, we define the SelfQuery class, which inherits from RAGStep
and implements the generate() method. The class can be found
at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/rag/self
_query.py:

## Page 584

class SelfQuery(RAGStep):
def generate(self, query: Query) -> Query:
if self._mock:
return query
In the generate() method, we check if the _mock attribute is set
to True . If it is, we will return the original query object unmodified.
This allows us to bypass calling the model while testing and
debugging. If not in mock mode, we create the prompt template and
initialize the language model.
prompt = SelfQueryTemplate().create_templa
model = ChatOpenAI(model=settings.OPENAI_M
Here, we instantiate the prompt using the SelfQueryTemplate
factory class and create a ChatOpenAI model instance (similar to
the query expansion implementation). We then combine the prompt
and the model into a chain and invoke it with the user’s query.
chain = prompt | model
response = chain.invoke({"question": query
user_full_name = response.content.strip("\

## Page 585

We extract the content from the LLM response and strip any leading
or trailing whitespace to obtain the user_full_name value. Next,
we check if the model was able to extract any user information.
if user_full_name == "none":
return query
If the response is "none" , it means no user name was found in the
query, so we return the original query object. If a user name is found,
we will split the user_full_name into the first_name and
last_name variables using a utility function. Then, based on the
user’s details, we retrieve or create a UserDocument user instance:
first_name, last_name = utils.split_user_f
user = UserDocument.get_or_create(first_na
Finally, we update the query object with the extracted author
information and return it:
query.author_id = user.id
query.author_full_name = user.full_name
return query

## Page 586

The updated query now contains the author_id and
author_full_name values, which can be used in subsequent steps
of the RAG pipeline.
Let’s look at the SelfQueryTemplate class, which defines the
prompt to extract user information:
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from .base import PromptTemplateFactory
class SelfQueryTemplate(PromptTemplateFactory):
prompt: str = """You are an AI language model
The required information that needs to be extr
Your response should consist of only the extra
If the user question does not contain any user
For example:
QUESTION 1:
My name is Paul Iusztin and I want a post abou
RESPONSE 1:

QUESTION 2:
I want to write a post about...
RESPONSE 2:
none
QUESTION 3:
My user id is 1345256 and I want to write a po

## Page 587

My user id is 1345256 and I want to write a po
RESPONSE 3:
1345256
User question: {question}"""
def create_template(self) -> PromptTemplate:
return PromptTemplate(template=self.prompt
In the SelfQueryTemplate class, we define a prompt instructing
the AI model to extract the user name or ID from the input question.
The prompt uses few-shot learning to guide the model on how to
respond in different scenarios. When the template is invoked, the
{question} placeholder will be replaced with the actual user
question.
By implementing self-querying, we ensure that critical metadata
required for our use case is explicitly extracted and used during
retrieval. This approach overcomes the limitations of relying solely
on the semantics of the embeddings to capture all necessary
aspects of a query.
Now that we’ve implemented the SelfQuery class, let’s provide an
example. Run the following code using the python -m
llm_engineering.application.rag.self_query CLI command:

## Page 588

query = Query.from_str("I am Paul Iusztin. Wri
self_query = SelfQuery()
query = self_query.generate(query)
logger.info(f"Extracted author_id: {query.auth
logger.info(f"Extracted author_full_name: {que
We get the following results where the author’s full name and ID
were extracted correctly:
2024-09-18 18:02:10.362 | INFO - Extracted author_
2024-09-18 18:02:10.362 | INFO - Extracted author_
Now that we understand how self-querying works, let’s explore how
it can be used together with filtered vector search within the retrieval
optimization step.
Advanced RAG retrieval optimization: filtered
vector search
Vector search is pivotal in retrieving relevant information based on
semantic similarity. A plain vector search, however, can introduce
significant challenges that affect both the accuracy and latency of
information retrieval. This is primarily because it operates solely on
the numerical proximity of vector embeddings without considering

## Page 589

the contextual or categorical nuances that might be crucial for
relevance.
One of the primary issues with plain vector search is retrieving
semantically similar but contextually irrelevant documents. Since
vector embeddings capture general semantic meanings, they might
assign high similarity scores to content that shares language
patterns or topics but doesn’t align with the specific intent or
constraints of the query. For instance, searching for “Java” could
retrieve documents about the programming language or the
Indonesian island, depending solely on semantic similarity, leading to
ambiguous or misleading results.
Moreover, as the size of the dataset increases, plain vector search
can suffer from scalability issues. The lack of filtering means the
search algorithm has to compute similarities across the entire vector
space, which can significantly increase latency.
This exhaustive search slows response times and consumes more
computational resources, making it inefficient for real-time or large-
scale applications.
Filtered vector search emerges as a solution by filtering after
additional criteria, such as metadata tags or categories, reducing the
search space before computing vector similarities. By applying these

## Page 590

filters, the search algorithm narrows the pool of potential results to
those contextually aligned with the query’s intent. This targeted
approach enhances accuracy by eliminating irrelevant documents
that might have otherwise been considered due to their semantic
similarities alone.
Additionally, filtered vector search improves latency by reducing the
number of comparisons the algorithm needs to perform. Working
with a smaller, more relevant subset of data decreases the
computational overhead, leading to faster response times. This
efficiency is crucial for applications requiring real-time interactions or
handling large queries.
As the metadata used within the filtered vector search is often part of
the user’s input, we have to extract it before querying the vector DB.
That’s precisely what we did during the self-query step, where we
extracted the author’s name to reduce the vector space only to the
author’s content. Thus, as we processed the query within the self-
query step, it went into the pre-retrieval optimization category,
whereas when the filtered vector search optimized the query, it went
into the retrieval optimization bin.
For example, when using Qdrant, to add a filter that looks for a
matching author_id within the metadata of each document, you
must implement the following code:

## Page 591

from qdrant_client.models import FieldCondition, F
records = qdrant_connection.search(
collection_name="articles",
query_vector=query_embedding,
limit=3,
with_payload=True,
query_filter= Filter(
must=[
FieldCondition(
key="author_id",
match=MatchValue(
value=str("1234"),
),
)
]
),
)
In essence, while plain vector search provides a foundation for
semantic retrieval, its limitations can slow performance in practical
applications. Filtered vector search addresses these challenges by
combining the strengths of vector embeddings with contextual
filtering, resulting in more accurate and efficient information retrieval
in RAG systems. The last step for optimizing our RAG pipeline is to
look into reranking.

## Page 592

Advanced RAG post-retrieval optimization:
reranking
The problem in RAG systems is that the retrieved context may
contain irrelevant chunks that only:
Add noise: The retrieved context might be irrelevant, cluttering
the information and potentially confusing the language model.
Make the prompt bigger: Including unnecessary chunks
increases the prompt size, leading to higher costs. Moreover,
language models are usually biased toward the context’s first and
last pieces. So, if you add a large amount of context, there’s a big
chance it will miss the essence.
Be come unaligned with your question: Chunks are retrieved
based on the similarity between the query and chunk
embeddings. The issue is that the embedding model might not be
tuned to your question, resulting in high similarity scores for
chunks that aren’t entirely relevant.
The solution is to use reranking to order all the N × K retrieved
chunks based on their relevance relative to the initial question,
where the first chunk will be the most relevant and the last the least.
N represents the number of searches after query expansion, while K
is the number of chunks retrieved per search. Hence, we retrieve a
total of N x K chunks. In RAG systems, reranking serves as a critical

## Page 593

post-retrieval step that refines the initial results obtained from the
retrieval model.
We assess each chunk’s relevance to the original query by applying
the reranking algorithm, which often uses advanced models like
neural cross-encoders. These models evaluate the semantic
similarity between the query and each chunk more accurately than
initial retrieval methods based on embeddings and the cosine
similarity distance, as explained in more detail in Chapter 4 in the An
overview of advanced RAG section.
Ultimately, we pick the top K most relevant chunks from the sorted
list of N x K items based on the reranking score. Reranking works
well when combined with query expansion. First, let’s understand
how reranking works without query expansion:
1. Search for > K chunks: Retrieve more than K chunks to have a
broader pool of potentially relevant information.
2. Reorder using rerank: Apply reranking to this larger set to
evaluate the actual relevance of each chunk relative to the query.
3. Take top K: Select the top K chunks to use them as context in the
final prompt.
Thus, when combined with query expansion, we gather potential
valuable context from multiple points in space rather than just

## Page 594

looking for more than K samples in a single location. Now the flow
looks like this:
1. Search for N × K chunks: Retrieve multiple sets of chunks using
the expanded queries.
2. Reorder using rerank: Rerank all the retrieved chunks based on
their relevance.
3. Take top K: Select the most relevant chunks for the final prompt.
Integrating reranking into the RAG pipeline enhances the quality and
relevance of the retrieved context and efficiently uses computational
resources. Let’s look at implementing the LLM Twin’s reranking step
to understand what we described above, which can be accessed on
GitHub at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/rag/rera
nking.py.
We begin by importing the necessary modules and classes for our
reranking process:
from llm_engineering.application.networks import C
from llm_engineering.domain.embedded_chunks import
from llm_engineering.domain.queries import Query
from .base import RAGStep

## Page 595

Next, we define the Reranker class, which is responsible for
reranking the retrieved documents based on their relevance to the
query:
class Reranker(RAGStep):
def __init__(self, mock: bool = False) -> None
super().__init__(mock=mock)
self._model = CrossEncoderModelSingleton()
In the initializer of the Reranker class, we instantiate our cross-
encoder model by creating an instance of
CrossEncoderModelSingleton . This is the cross-encoder model
used to score the relevance of each document chunk with respect to
the query.
The core functionality of the Reranker class is implemented in the
generate() method:
def generate(self, query: Query, chunks: list[
if self._mock:
return chunks
query_doc_tuples = [(query.content, chunk.
scores = self._model(query_doc_tuples)
scored_query_doc_tuples = list(zip(scores,
scored_query_doc_tuples.sort(key=lambda x:
reranked documents = scored query doc tupl

## Page 596

reranked_documents = scored_query_doc_tupl
reranked_documents = [doc for _, doc in re
return reranked_documents
The generate() method takes a query, a list of chunks (document
segments), and the number of top documents to keep
( keep_top_k ). If we’re in mock mode, it simply returns the original
chunks. Otherwise, it performs the following steps:
1. Creates pairs of the query content and each chunk’s content
2. Uses the cross-encoder model to score each pair, assessing how
well the chunk matches the query
3. Zips the scores with the corresponding chunks to create a scored
list of tuples
4. Sorts this list in descending order based on the scores
5. Selects the top keep_top_k chunks
6. Extracts the chunks from the tuples and returns them as the
reranked documents
Before defining the CrossEncoder class, we import the necessary
components:
from sentence_transformers.cross_encoder import Cr
from .base import SingletonMeta

## Page 597

We import the CrossEncoder class from the
sentence_transformers library, which provides the functionality for
scoring text pairs. We also import SingletonMeta from our base
module to ensure our model class follows the singleton pattern,
meaning only one instance of the model exists throughout the
application. Now, we define the CrossEncoderModelSingleton
class:
class CrossEncoderModelSingleton(metaclass=Singlet
def __init__(
self,
model_id: str = settings.RERANKING_CROSS_E
device: str = settings.RAG_MODEL_DEVICE,
) -> None:
"""
A singleton class that provides a pre-trai
"""
self._model_id = model_id
self._device = device
self._model = CrossEncoder(
model_name=self._model_id,
device=self._device,
)
self._model.model.eval()

## Page 598

This class initializes the cross-encoder model using the specified
model_id and device from the global settings loaded from the
.env file. We set the model to evaluation mode using
self._model.model.eval() to ensure the model is ready for
inference.
The CrossEncoderModelSingleton class includes a callable
method to score text pairs:
def __call__(self, pairs: list[tuple[str, str]
scores = self._model.predict(pairs)
if to_list:
scores = scores.tolist()
return scores
The __call__ method allows us to pass in a list of text pairs
(each consisting of the query and a document chunk) and receive
their relevance scores. The method uses the model’s predict()
function to call the model and compute the scores.
The CrossEncoderModelSingleton class is a wrapper over the
CrossEncoder class, which we wrote for two purposes. The first
one is for the singleton pattern, which allows us to easily access the
same instance of the cross-encoder model from anywhere within the
application without loading the model in memory every time we need

## Page 599

it. The second reason is that by writing our wrapper, we defined our
interface for a cross-encoder model (or any other model used for
reranking). This makes the code future-proof as in case we need a
different implementation or strategy for reranking, for example, using
an API, we only have to write a different wrapper that follows the
same interface and swap the old class with the new one. Thus, we
can introduce new reranking methods without touching the rest of
the code.
We now understand all the advanced RAG techniques used within
our architecture. In the next section, we will examine the
ContextRetriever class that connects all these methods and
explain how to use the retrieval module with an LLM for an end-to-
end RAG inference pipeline.
Implementing the LLM Twin’s RAG
inference pipeline
As explained at the beginning of this chapter, the RAG inference
pipeline can mainly be divided into three parts: the retrieval module,
the prompt creation, and the answer generation, which boils down to
calling an LLM with the augmented prompt. In this section, our
primary focus will be implementing the retrieval module, where most
of the code and logic go. Afterward, we will look at how to build the
final prompt using the retrieved context and user query.

## Page 600

Ultimately, we will examine how to combine the retrieval module,
prompt creation logic, and the LLM to capture an end-to-end RAG
workflow. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to test out the LLM until we
finish Chapter 10, as we haven’t deployed our fine-tuned LLM Twin
module to AWS SageMaker.
Thus, by the end of this section, you will learn how to implement the
RAG inference pipeline, which you can test out end to end only after
finishing Chapter 10. Now, let’s start by looking at the
implementation of the retrieval module.
Implementing the retrieval module
Let’s dive into the ContextRetriever class implementation, which
orchestrates the retrieval step in our RAG system by integrating all
the advanced techniques we previously used: query expansion, self-
querying, reranking, and filtered vector search. The class can be
found on GitHub at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/application/rag/retr
iever.py.

## Page 601

Figure 9.2: Search logic of the RAG retrieval module
The entry point function of the ContextRetriever class is the
search() method, which calls all the advanced steps discussed in
this chapter. Figure 9.2 shows in more detail how the search method
glues together all the steps required to search results similar to the

## Page 602

user’s query. It highlights how the extracted author details from the
self-query step are used within the filtered vector search. Also, it
zooms in on the search operation itself, where, for each query, we do
three searches to the vector DB, looking for articles, posts, or
repositories similar to the query. For each search (out of N
searches), we want to retrieve a maximum of K results. Thus, we
retrieve a maximum of K / 3 items for each data category (as we
have three categories). Therefore, when summed up, we will have a
list of ≤ K chunks. The retrieved list is ≤ K (and not equal to K)
when a particular data category or more returns < K / 3 items
after applying the author filters due to missing chunks for that
specific author or data category.

## Page 603

Figure 9.3: Processing the results flow of the RAG retrieval module
Figure 9.3 illustrates how we process the results returned by the xN
searches. As each search returns ≤ K items, we will end up with ≤
N x K chunks that we aggregate into a single list. As some results
might overlap between searchers, we must deduplicate the

## Page 604

aggregated list to ensure each chunk is unique. Ultimately, we send
the results to the rerank model, order them based on their reranking
score, and pick the most relevant top K chunks we will use as
context for RAG.
Let’s understand how everything from Figures 9.2 and 9.3 is
implemented in the ContextRetriever class. First, we initialize the
class by setting up instances of the QueryExpansion , SelfQuery ,
and Reranker classes:
class ContextRetriever:
def __init__(self, mock: bool = False) -> None
self._query_expander = QueryExpansion(mock
self._metadata_extractor = SelfQuery(mock=
self._reranker = Reranker(mock=mock)
In the search() method, we convert the user’s input string into a
query object. We then use the SelfQuery instance to extract the
author_id and author_full_name from the query:
def search(
self,
query: str,
k: int = 3,
expand_to_n_queries: int = 3,
) -> list:

## Page 605

) -> list:
query_model = Query.from_str(query)
query_model = self._metadata_extractor.gen
logger.info(
"Successfully extracted the author_id
author_id=query_model.author_id,
)
Next, we expand the query to generate multiple semantically similar
queries using the QueryExpansion instance:
n_generated_queries = self._query_expander
logger.info(
"Successfully generated queries for se
num_queries=len(n_generated_queries),
)
We then perform the search concurrently for all expanded queries
using a thread pool. Each query is processed by the _search()
method, which we’ll explore shortly. The results are flattened,
deduplicated, and collected into a single list:
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
search_tasks = [executor.submit(self._
n_k_documents = [task.result() for tas
n k documents = utils misc flatten(n k

## Page 606

n_k_documents = utils.misc.flatten(n_k
n_k_documents = list(set(n_k_documents
logger.info("All documents retrieved succe
After retrieving the documents, we rerank them based on their
relevance to the original query and keep only the top k documents:
if len(n_k_documents) > 0:
k_documents = self.rerank(query, chunk
else:
k_documents = []
return k_documents
The _search() method performs the filtered vector search across
different data categories like posts, articles, and repositories. It uses
the EmbeddingDispatcher to convert the query into an
EmbeddedQuery , which includes the query’s embedding vector and
any extracted metadata:
def _search(self, query: Query, k: int = 3) ->
assert k >= 3, "k should be >= 3"
def _search_data_category(
data_category_odm: type[EmbeddedChunk]
) -> list[EmbeddedChunk]:
if embedded_query.author_id:
query filter = Filter(

## Page 607

query_filter = Filter(
must=[
FieldCondition(
key="author_id",
match=MatchValue(
value=str(embedded
),
)
]
)
else:
query_filter = None
return data_category_odm.search(
query_vector=embedded_query.embedd
limit=k // 3,
query_filter=query_filter,
)
embedded_query: EmbeddedQuery = EmbeddingD
We used the same EmbeddingDispatcher to embed the query as
in the RAG feature pipeline to embed the document chunks stored in
the vector DB. Using the same class ensures we use the same
embedding model at ingestion and query time, which is critical for
the retrieval step.
We search each data category separately by leveraging the local
_search_data_category() function. Within the

## Page 608

_search_data_category() function, we apply the filters extracted
from the embedded_query object. For instance, if an author_id is
present, we use it to filter the search results only to include
documents from that author. The results from all categories are then
combined:
post_chunks = _search_data_category(Embedd
articles_chunks = _search_data_category(Em
repositories_chunks = _search_data_categor
retrieved_chunks = post_chunks + articles_
return retrieved_chunks
Finally, the rerank() method takes the original query and the list of
retrieved documents to reorder them based on relevance:
def rerank(self, query: str | Query, chunks: l
if isinstance(query, str):
query = Query.from_str(query)
reranked_documents = self._reranker.genera
logger.info("Documents reranked successful
return reranked_documents
Leveraging the ContextRetriever class, we can retrieve context
from any query with only a few lines of code. For example, let’s take

## Page 609

a look at the following code snippet, where we call the entire
advanced RAG architecture with a simple call to the search()
method:
from loguru import logger
from llm_engineering.application.rag.retriever imp
query = """
My name is Paul Iusztin.
Could you draft a LinkedIn post discussing
I'm particularly interested in:
- how RAG works
- how it is integrated with vector DBs
"""
retriever = ContextRetriever(mock=False)
documents = retriever.search(query, k=3)
logger.info("Retrieved documents:")
for rank, document in enumerate(documents):
logger.info(f"{rank + 1}: {document}")
Calling the code from above using the following CLI command:
poetry poe call-rag-retrieval-module . This outputs the
following:

## Page 610

com/decodingml/the-4-advanced-rag-algorithms-you-m
As you can observe in the output above, along with the retrieved
content, we have access to all kinds of metadata, such as the
embedding model used for retrieval or the link from which the chunk
was taken. These can quickly be added to a list of references when
generating the result for the user, increasing trust in the final results.
Now that we understand how the retrieval module works, let’s take a
final step and examine the end-to-end RAG inference pipeline.
Bringing everything together into the RAG
inference pipeline
To fully implement the RAG flow, we still have to build the prompt
using the context from the retrieval model and call the LLM to
generate the answer. This section will discuss these two steps and
wrap everything together into a single rag() function. The functions
from this section can be accessed on GitHub at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-

## Page 611

Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/infrastructure/infer
ence_pipeline_api.py.
Let’s start by looking at the call_llm_service() function,
responsible for interfacing with the LLM service. It takes in a user’s
query and an optional context, sets up the language model endpoint,
executes the inference, and returns the generated answer. The
context is optional; you can call the LLM without it, as you would
when interacting with any other LLM:
def call_llm_service(query: str, context: str | No
llm = LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint(
endpoint_name=settings.SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_
)
answer = InferenceExecutor(llm, query, context
return answer
This function makes an HTTP request to our fine-tuned LLM Twin
model, which is hosted as an AWS SageMaker inference endpoint.
We will explore all the SageMaker details in the next chapter, where
we will dig into the LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint and
InferenceExecutor classes. For now, what is essential to know is
that we use this function to call our fine-tuned LLM. Still, we must
highlight how the query and context, passed to the
InferenceExecutor class, are transformed into the final prompt.

## Page 612

We do that using a simple prompt template that is customized using
the user query and retrieved context:
prompt = f"""
You are a content creator. Write what the user ask
User query: {query}
Context: {context}
"""
Moving on to the rag() function, this is where the RAG logic comes
together. It handles retrieving relevant documents based on the
query, mapping the documents to the context that will be injected
into the prompt, and obtaining the final answer from the LLM:
def rag(query: str) -> str:
retriever = ContextRetriever(mock=False)
documents = retriever.search(query, k=3)
context = EmbeddedChunk.to_context(documents)
answer = call_llm_service(query, context)
return answer
As we modularized all the RAG steps into independent classes, we
reduced the high-level rag() function to five lines of code
(encapsulating all the complexities of the system) similar to what we
see in tools such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Haystack. Instead of

## Page 613

their high-level implementation, we learned how to build an
advanced RAG service from scratch. Also, by clearly separating the
responsibility of each class, we can use them like LEGOs. Thus, you
can quickly call the LLM independently without context or use the
retrieval module as a query engine on top of your vector DB. In the
next chapter, we will see the rag() function in action after we
deploy our fine-tuned LLM to an AWS SageMaker inference
endpoint.
Before ending this chapter, we want to discuss potential
improvements you could add to the RAG inference pipeline. As we
are building a chatbot, the first one is to add a conversation memory
that stores all the user prompts and generated answers in memory.
Thus, when interacting with the chatbot, it will be aware of the whole
conversation, not only the latest prompt. When prompting the LLM,
along with the new user input and context, we also pass the
conversation history from the memory. As the conversation history
can get long, to avoid exceeding the context window or higher costs,
you have to implement a way to reduce the size of your memory. As
illustrated in Figure 9.4, the simplest one is to keep only the latest K
items from your chat history. Unfortunately, using this strategy, the
LLM will never be aware of the whole conversation.
Therefore, another way to add the chat history to your prompt is to
keep a summary of the conversation along with the latest K replies.

## Page 614

There are multiple ways to compute this summary, which might
defeat the purpose of this book if we get into them all, but the
simplest way is to always update the summary on every user prompt
and generate an answer.

## Page 615

Figure 9.4: Routing and memory examples
As for each search, we send three queries to the vector DB, one for
each data category. Thus, the second improvement is to add a router
between the query and the search. The router will be a multi-
category classifier that predicts the data categories we must retrieve
for that specific query. Hence, instead of making three requests for
every search, we can often reduce it to one or two. For example, if
the user wants to write a theoretical paragraph about RAG for an
article, then most probably, it’s valuable to query only the article’s
collection. In this case, the router will predict the article class, which
we can use to decide what collection we must query.
Another example would be if we want to illustrate a piece of code
that shows how to build a RAG pipeline. In this case, the router
would have to predict the article and repository data category, as we
need to look up examples in both collections for an exhaustive
context.
Usually, the router strategy decides what model to call based on a
user’s input, such as whether to use GPT-4 or a self-hosted Llama
3.1 model for that specific query. However, in our particular use
case, we can adapt the router algorithm to optimize the retrieval
step.

## Page 616

We can further optimize the retrieval using a hybrid search algorithm
that combines the vector search (based on embeddings) with a
keyword search algorithm, such as BM25. Search algorithms used
BM25 (or similar methods) to find similar items in a DB before vector
search algorithms became popular. By merging the methods, hybrid
search retrieves results that match the exact terms, such as RAG,
LLM, or SageMaker, and the query semantics, increasing the
accuracy and relevance of your retrieved results. Fundamentally, the
hybrid search algorithms follow the next mechanics:
1. Parallel processing: The search query is processed
simultaneously through both the vector search and BM25
algorithms. Each algorithm retrieves a set of relevant documents
based on its criteria.
2. Score normalization: The results from both searches are
assigned relevance scores, which are then normalized to ensure
comparability. This step is crucial because vector search and
BM25 scoring mechanisms work at different scales. Thus, they
can’t be compared or merged without normalization.
3. Result merging: The normalized scores are combined, often
through a weighted sum, to produce a final ranking of documents.
Adjusting the weights allows for fine-tuning the emphasis on the
semantic or keyword search algorithm.

## Page 617

To conclude, by combining the semantic and exact keyword search
algorithms, you can improve the accuracy of your retrieval step.
Vector search helps recognize synonyms or related concepts,
ensuring that relevant information isn’t overlooked due to vocabulary
differences. Keyword search ensures that documents containing
critical keywords are emphasized appropriately, particularly in
technical fields with specific terminology.
One last improvement we can make to our RAG system is to use
multi-index vector structures instead of indexing based only on the
content’s embedding. Let’s detail how multi-indexing works. Instead
of using the embeddings of a single field to do the vector search for
a particular collection, it combines multiple fields.
For example, in our LLM Twin use case, we used only the content
field of our articles, posts, or repositories to query the vector DB.
When using a multi-index strategy, along with the content field, we
could index the embeddings of the platform where the content was
posted or when the content was published. This could impact the
final accuracy of your retrieval as different platforms have different
types of content, or more recent content is usually more relevant.
Frameworks such as Superlinked make multi-indexing easy. For
example, in the code snippet below, using Superlinked, we defined a
multi-index on the content and platform for our article collection in
just a few lines of code:

## Page 618

from superlinked.framework.common.schema.id_schema
from superlinked.framework.common.schema.schema im
from superlinked.framework.common.schema.schema_ob
… # Other Superlinked imports.
@schema
class ArticleSchema:
id: IdField
platform: String
content: String
article = ArticleSchema()
articles_space_content = TextSimilaritySpace(
text=chunk(article.content, chunk_size=500, ch
model=settings.EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID,
)
articles_space_plaform = CategoricalSimilaritySpac
category_input=article.platform,
categories=["medium", "substack", "wordpress"]
negative_filter=-5.0,
)
article_index = Index(
[articles_space_content, articles_space_plafor
fields=[article.author_id],
)
Superlinked is a powerful Python tool for any use case that includes
vector computing, such as RAG, recommender systems, and

## Page 619

semantic search. It offers an ecosystem where you can quickly
ingest data into a vector DB, write complex queries on top of it, and
deploy the service as a RESTful API.
The world of LLMs and RAG is experimental, similar to any other AI
domain. Thus, when building real-world products, it’s important to
quickly build an end-to-end solution that works but is not necessarily
the best. Then, you can reiterate with various experiments until you
completely optimize it for your use case. This is standard practice in
the industry and lets you iterate fast while providing value to the
business and gathering user feedback as quickly as possible in the
product’s lifecycle.
Summary
This chapter taught us how to build an advanced RAG inference
pipeline. We started by looking into the software architecture of the
RAG system. Then, we zoomed in on the advanced RAG methods
we used within the retrieval module, such as query expansion, self-
querying, filtered vector search, and reranking. Afterward, we saw
how to write a modular ContextRetriever class that glues all the
advanced RAG components under a single interface, making
searching for relevant documents a breeze. Ultimately, we looked
into how to connect all the missing dots, such as the retrieval, the

prompt augmentation, and the LLM call, under a single RAG function
that will serve as our RAG inference pipeline.
As highlighted a few times in this chapter, we couldn’t test our fine-
tuned LLM because we haven’t deployed it yet to AWS SageMaker
as an inference endpoint. Thus, in the next chapter, we will learn
how to deploy the LLM to AWS SageMaker, write an inference
interface to call the endpoint, and implement a FastAPI web server
to serve as our business layer.

Inference Pipeline Deployment
Deploying the inference pipeline for the large language model
(LLM) Twin application is a critical stage in the machine learning
(ML) application life cycle. It’s where the most value is added to your
business, making your models accessible to your end users.
However, successfully deploying AI models can be challenging, as
the models require expensive computing power and access to up-to-
date features to run the inference. To overcome these constraints,
it’s crucial to carefully design your deployment strategy. This ensures
that it meets the application’s requirements, such as latency,
throughput, and costs. As we work with LLMs, we must consider the
inference optimization techniques presented in Chapter 8, such as
model quantization. Also, to automate the deployment processes, we
must leverage MLOps best practices, such as model registries that
version and share our models across our infrastructure.
To understand how to design the deployment architecture of the LLM
Twin, we will first look at three deployment types we can choose
from: online real-time inference, asynchronous inference, and offline
batch transform. Also, to better understand which option to choose
for our LLM Twin use case, we will quickly walk you through a set of
critical criteria we must consider before making an architectural

## Page 625

decision, such as latency, throughput, data, and infrastructure. Also,
we’ll weigh the pros and cons of monolithic and microservices
architecture in model serving, a decision that can significantly
influence the scalability and maintainability of your service.Once
we’ve grasped the various design choices available, we’ll focus on
understanding the deployment strategy for the LLM Twin’s inference
pipeline. Subsequently, we will walk you through an end-to-end
tutorial on deploying the LLM Twin service, including deploying our
custom fine-tuned LLM to AWS SageMaker endpoints and
implementing a FastAPI server as the central entry point for our
users. We will then wrap up this chapter with a short discussion on
autoscaling strategies and how to use them on SageMaker.
Hence, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
Criteria for choosing deployment types
Understanding inference deployment types
Monolithic versus microservices architecture in model serving
Exploring the LLM Twin’s inference pipeline deployment strategy
Deploying the LLM Twin service
Autoscaling capabilities to handle spikes in usage

When it comes to deploying ML models, the first step is to
understand the four requirements present in every ML application:
throughput, latency, data, and infrastructure.
Understanding them and their interaction is essential. When
designing the deployment architecture for your models, there is
always a trade-off between the four that will directly impact the user’s
experience. For example, should your model deployment be
optimized for low latency or high throughput?
Throughput and latency
Throughput refers to the number of inference requests a system
can process in a given period. It is typically measured in requests
per second (RPS). Throughput is crucial when deploying ML models
when you expect to process many requests. It ensures the system
can handle many requests efficiently without becoming a bottleneck.
High throughput often requires scalable and robust infrastructure,
such as machines or clusters with multiple high-end GPUs.Latency
is the time it takes for a system to process a single inference request
from when it is received until the result is returned. Latency is critical
in real-time applications where quick response times are essential,
such as in live user interactions, fraud detection, or any system
requiring immediate feedback. For example, the average latency of

## Page 627

OpenAI’s API is the average response time from when a user sends
a request, and the service provides a result that is accessible within
your application.
The latency is the sum of the network I/O, serialization and
deserialization, and the LLM’s inference time. Meanwhile, the
throughput is the average number of requests the API processes and
serves a second.
Low-latency systems require optimized and often more costly
infrastructure, such as faster processors, lower network latency, and
possibly edge computing to reduce the distance data needs to travel.
A lower latency translates to higher throughput when the service
processes multiple queries in parallel successfully. For example, if
the service takes 100 ms to process requests, this translates to a
throughput of 10 requests per second. If the latency reaches 10 ms
per request, the throughput rises to 100 requests per second.
However, to complicate things, most ML applications adopt a
batching strategy to simultaneously pass multiple data samples to
the model. In this case, a lower latency can translate into lower
throughput; in other words, a higher latency maps to a higher
throughput. For example, if you process 20 batched requests in 100
ms, the latency is 100 ms, while the throughput is 200 requests per

## Page 628

second. If you process 60 requests in 200 ms, the latency is 200 ms,
while the throughput rises to 300 requests per second. Thus, even
when batching requests at serving time, it’s essential to consider the
minimum latency accepted for a good user experience.
Data
As we know, data is everywhere in an ML system. But when talking
about model serving, we mostly care about the model’s input and
output. This includes the format, volume, and complexity of the
processed data. Data is the foundation of the inference process. The
characteristics of the data, such as its size and type, determine how
the system needs to be configured and optimized for efficient
processing.
The type and size of the data directly impact latency and throughput,
as more complex or extensive data can take longer to process. For
example, designing a model that takes input structured data and
outputs a probability differs entirely from an LLM that takes input text
(or even images) and outputs an array of characters.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware, software,
networking, and system architecture that supports the deployment
and operation of the ML models. The infrastructure provides the

## Page 629

necessary resources for deploying, scaling, and maintaining ML
models. It includes computing resources, memory, storage,
networking components, and the software stack:
For high throughput, the systems require scalable infrastructure
to manage large data volumes and high request rates, possibly
through parallel processing, distributed systems, and high-end
GPUs.
Infrastructure must be optimized to reduce processing time to
achieve low latency, such as using faster CPUs, GPUs, or
specialized hardware. While optimizing your system for low
latency while batching your requests, you often have to sacrifice
high throughput in favor of lower latency, which can result in your
hardware not being utilized at total capacity. As you process fewer
requests per second, it results in idle computing, which increases
the overall cost of processing a request. Thus, picking the suitable
machine for your requirements is critical in optimizing costs.
It is crucial to design infrastructure to meet specific data
requirements. This includes selecting storage solutions to handle
large datasets and implementing fast retrieval mechanisms to ensure
efficient data access. For example, we mostly care about optimizing
throughput for offline training, while for online inference, we generally
care about latency.

## Page 630

With this in mind, before picking a specific deployment type, you
should ask yourself questions such as:
What are the throughput requirements? You should make this
decision based on the throughput’s required minimum, average,
and maximum statistics.
How many requests the system must handle simultaneously? (1,
10, 1,000, 1 million, etc.)
What are the latency requirements? (1 millisecond, 10
milliseconds, 1 second, etc.)
How should the system scale? For example, we should look at the
CPU workload, number of requests, queue size, data size, or a
combination of them.
What are the cost requirements?With what data do we work with?
For example, do we work with images, text, or tabular data?
What is the size of the data we work with? (100 MB, 1 GB, 10 GB)
Deeply thinking about these questions directly impacts the user
experience of your application, which ultimately makes the difference
between a successful product and not. Even if you ship a mind-
blowing model, if the user needs to wait too long for a response or it
often crashes, the user will switch your production to something less
accurate that works reliably. For example, Google found in a 2016
study that 53% of visits are abandoned if a mobile site takes longer
than three seconds to load:

## Page 631

insights/consumer-trends/mobile-site-load-time-
statistics/.
Let’s move on to the three deployment architectures we can
leverage to serve our models.
Understanding inference deployment
types
As illustrated in Figure 10.1, you can choose from three fundamental
deployment types when serving models:
Online real-time inference
Asynchronous inference
Offline batch transform
When selecting one design over the other, there is a trade-off
between latency, throughput, and costs. You must consider how the
data is accessed and the infrastructure you are working with.
Another criterion you have to consider is how the user will interact
with the model. For example, will the user use it directly, like a
chatbot, or will it be hidden within your system, like a classifier that
checks if an input (or output) is safe?

## Page 632

You have to consider the freshness of the predictions as well. For
example, serving your model in offline batch mode might be easier to
implement if, in your use case, it is OK to consume delayed
predictions. Otherwise, you have to serve your model in real-time,
which is more infrastructure-demanding. Also, you have to consider
your application’s traffic. Ask yourself questions such as, “Will the
application be constantly used, or will there be spikes in traffic and
then flatten out?”
With that in mind, let’s explore the three major ML deployment types.

## Page 633

Figure 10.1: The three fundamental architectures of inference
deployment types
Online real-time inference

## Page 634

In real-time inference, we have a simple architecture based on a
server that can be accessed through HTTP requests. The most
popular options are to implement a REST API or gRPC server. The
REST API is more accessible but slower, using JSON to pass data
between the client and server.
This approach is usually taken when serving models outside your
internal network to the broader public. For example, OpenAI’s API
implements a REST API protocol.
On the other hand, implementing a gRPC makes your ML server
faster, though it may reduce its flexibility and general applicability.
You have to implement protobuf schemas in your client
application, which are more tedious to work with than JSON
structures. The benefit, however, is that protobuf objects can be
compiled into bites, making the network transfers much faster. Thus,
this protocol is often adopted for internal services within the same
ML system.
Using the real-time inference approach, the client sends an HTTP
request to the ML service, which immediately processes the request
and returns the result in the same response. This synchronous
interaction means the client waits for the result before moving on.

## Page 635

To make this work efficiently, the infrastructure must support low-
latency, highly responsive ML services, often deployed on fast,
scalable servers. Load balancing is crucial to evenly distribute
incoming traffic evenly, while autoscaling ensures the system can
handle varying loads. High availability is also essential to keeping
the service operational at all times.
For example, this architecture is often present when interacting with
LLMs, as when sending a request to a chatbot or API (powered by
LLMs), you expend the predictions right ahead. LLM services, such
as ChatGPT or Claude, often use WebSockets to stream each token
individually to the end user, making the interaction more responsive.
Other famous examples are AI services such as embedding or
reranking models used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
or online recommendation engines in platforms like TikTok.
The simplicity of real-time inference, with its direct client-server
interaction, makes it an attractive option for applications that require
immediate responses, like chatbots or real-time recommendations.
However, this approach can be challenging to scale and may lead to
underutilized resources during low-traffic periods.
Asynchronous inference

## Page 636

In asynchronous inference, the client sends a request to the ML
service, which acknowledges the request and places it in a queue for
processing. Unlike real-time inference, the client doesn’t wait for an
immediate response. Instead, the ML service processes the request
asynchronously. This requires a robust infrastructure that queues the
messages to be processed by the ML service later on.
When the results are ready, you can leverage multiple techniques to
send them to the client. For example, depending on the size of the
result, you can put it either in a different queue or an object storage
dedicated to storing the results.
The client can either adopt a polling mechanism that checks on a
schedule if there are new results or adopt a push strategy and
implement a notification system to inform the client when the results
are ready.
Asynchronous inference uses resources more efficiently. It doesn’t
have to process all the requests simultaneously but can define a
maximum number of machines that run in parallel to process the
messages. This is possible because the requests are stored in the
queue until a machine can process them. Another huge benefit is
that it can handle spikes in requests without any timeouts. For
example, let’s assume that on an e-shop site, we usually have 10
requests per second handled by two machines. Because of a

## Page 637

promotion, many people started to visit the site, and the number of
requests spiked to 100 requests per second. Instead of scaling the
number of virtual machines (VMs) by 10, which can add drastic
costs, the requests are queued, and the same two VMs can process
them in their rhythm without any failures.
Another popular advantage for asynchronous architectures is when
the requested job takes significant time to complete. For example, if
the job takes over five minutes, you don’t want to block the client
waiting for a response.
While asynchronous inference offers significant benefits, it does
come with trade-offs. It introduces higher latency, making it less
suitable for time-sensitive applications. Additionally, it adds
complexity to the implementation and infrastructure. Depending on
your design choices, this architecture type falls somewhere between
online and offline, offering a balance of benefits and trade-offs.
For example, this is a robust design where you don’t care too much
about the latency of the inference but want to optimize costs heavily.
Thus, it is a popular choice for problems such as extracting
keywords from documents, summarizing them using LLMs, or
running deep-fake models on top of videos. But suppose you
carefully design the autoscaling system to process the requests from
the queue at decent speeds. In that case, you can leverage this

## Page 638

design for other use cases, such as online recommendations for e-
commerce. In the end, it sums up how much computing power you
are willing to pay to meet the expectations of your application.
Offline batch transform
Batch transform is about processing large volumes of data
simultaneously, either on a schedule or triggered manually. In a
batch transform architecture, the ML service pulls data from a
storage system, processes it in a single operation, and then stores
the results in storage. The storage system can be implemented as
an object storage like AWS S3 or a data warehouse like GCP
BigQuery.
Unlike the asynchronous inference architecture, a batch transform
design is optimized for high throughput with permissive latency
requirements. When real-time predictions are unnecessary, this
approach can significantly reduce costs, as processing data in big
batches is the most economical method. Moreover, the batch
transform architecture is the simplest way to serve a model,
accelerating development time.
The client pulls the results directly from data storage, decoupling its
interaction with the ML service. Taking this approach, the client never
has to wait for the ML service to process its input, but at the same

## Page 639

time, it doesn’t have the flexibility to ask for new results at any time.
You can see the data storage, where the results are stored as a
large cache, from where the client can take what is required. If you
want to make your application more responsive, the client can be
notified when the processing is complete and can retrieve the
results.
Unfortunately, this approach will always introduce a delay between
the time the predictions were computed and consumed. That’s why
not all applications can leverage this design choice. For example, if
we implement a recommender system for a video streaming
application, having a delay of one day for the predicted movies and
TV shows might work because you don’t consume these products at
a high frequency. But suppose you make a recommender system for
a social media platform. In that case, delaying one day or even one
hour is unacceptable, as you constantly want to provide fresh
content to the user.
Batch transform shines in scenarios where high throughput is
needed, like data analytics or periodic reporting. However, it’s
unsuitable for real-time applications due to its high latency and
requires careful planning and scheduling to manage large datasets
effectively. That’s why it is an offline serving method.

## Page 640

To conclude, we examined the three most common architectures for
serving ML models. We started with online real-time inference, which
serves clients when they request a prediction. Then, we looked at
the asynchronous inference method, which sits between online and
offline. Ultimately, we presented the offline batch transform, which is
used to process large amounts of data and store them in data
storage, from where the client later consumes them.
Monolithic versus microservices
architecture in model serving
In the previous section, we saw three different methods of deploying
the ML service. The differences in architecture were mainly based on
the interaction between the client and the ML service, such as the
communication protocol, the ML service responsiveness, and
prediction freshness.
But another aspect to consider is the architecture of the ML service
itself, which can be implemented as a monolithic server or as
multiple microservices. This will impact how the ML service is
implemented, maintained, and scaled. Let’s explore the two options.

## Page 641

Figure 10.2: Monolithic versus microservices architecture in model
serving
Monolithic architecture

## Page 642

The LLM (or any other ML model) and the associated business logic
(preprocessing and post-processing steps) are bundled into a single
service in a monolithic architecture. This approach is straightforward
to implement at the beginning of a project, as everything is placed
within one code base. Simplicity makes maintenance easy when
working on small to medium projects, as updates and changes can
be made within a unified system.
One key challenge of a monolithic architecture is the difficulty of
scaling components independently. The LLM typically requires GPU
power, while the rest of the business logic is CPU and I/O-bound. As
a result, the infrastructure must be optimized for both GPU and CPU.
This can lead to inefficient resource use, with the GPU being idle
when the business logic is executed and vice versa. Such
inefficiency can result in additional costs that could be avoided.
Moreover, this architecture can limit flexibility, as all components
must share the same tech stack and runtime environment. For
example, you might want to run the LLM using Rust or C++ or
compile it with ONNX or TensorRT while keeping the business logic
in Python. Having all the code in one system makes this
differentiation difficult. Finally, splitting the work across different
teams is complex, often leading to bottlenecks and reduced agility.
Microservices architecture

## Page 643

A microservices architecture breaks down the inference pipeline into
separate, independent services—typically splitting the LLM service
and the business logic into distinct components. These services
communicate over a network using protocols such as REST or
gRPC.
As illustrated in Figure 10.3, the main advantage of this approach is
the ability to scale each component independently. For instance,
since the LLM service might require more GPU resources than the
business logic, it can be scaled horizontally without impacting the
other components. This optimizes resource usage and reduces
costs, as different types of machines (e.g., GPU versus CPU) can be
used according to each service’s needs.
For example, let’s assume that the LLM inference takes longer, so
you will need more ML service replicas to meet the demand. But
remember that GPU VMs are expensive. By decoupling the two
components, you will run only what is required on the GPU machine
and not block the GPU VM with other computing that can be done on
a much cheaper machine.
Thus, by decoupling the components, you can scale horizontally as
required, with minimal costs, providing a cost-effective solution to
your system’s needs.

## Page 644

Figure 10.3: Scaling microservices independently based on compute
requirements
Additionally, each microservice can adopt the most suitable
technology stack, allowing teams to innovate and optimize
independently.

## Page 645

However, microservices introduce complexity in deployment and
maintenance. Each service must be deployed, monitored, and
maintained separately, which can be more challenging than
managing a monolithic system.
The increased network communication between services can also
introduce latency and potential points of failure, necessitating robust
monitoring and resilience mechanisms.
Note that the proposed design for decoupling the ML model and
business logic into two services can be extended if necessary. For
example, you can have one service for preprocessing the data, one
for the model, and another for post-processing the data. Depending
on the four pillars (latency, throughput, data, and infrastructure), you
can get creative and design the most optimal architecture for your
application needs.
Choosing between monolithic and microservices
architectures
The choice between monolithic and microservices architectures for
serving ML models largely depends on the application’s specific
needs. A monolithic approach might be ideal for smaller teams or
more straightforward applications where ease of development and
maintenance is a priority. It’s also a good starting point for projects

## Page 646

without frequent scaling requirements. Also, if the ML models are
smaller, don’t require a GPU, or don’t require smaller and cheaper
GPUs, the trade-off between reducing costs and complicating your
infrastructure is worth considering.
On the other hand, microservices, with their adaptability and
scalability, are well suited for larger, more complex systems where
different components have varying scaling needs or require distinct
tech stacks. This architecture is particularly advantageous when
scaling specific system parts, such as GPU-intensive LLM services.
As LLMs require powerful machines with GPUs, such as Nvidia
A100, V100, or A10g, which are incredibly costly, microservices offer
the flexibility to optimize the system for keeping these machines
busy all the time or quickly scaling down when the GPU is idle.
However, this flexibility comes at the cost of increased complexity in
both development and operations.
A common strategy is to start with a monolithic design and further
decouple it into multiple services as the project grows. However, to
successfully do so without making the transition too complex and
costly, you must design the monolith application with this in mind.
For instance, even if all the code runs on a single machine, you can
completely decouple the modules of the application at the software
level. This makes it easier to move these modules to different
microservices when the time comes. When working with Python, for

## Page 647

example, you can implement the ML and business logic into two
different Python modules that don’t interact with each other. Then,
you can glue these two modules at a higher level, such as through a
service class, or directly into the framework you use to expose your
application over the internet, such as FastAPI.
Another option is to write the ML and business logic as two different
Python packages that you glue together in the same ways as before.
This is better because it completely enforces a separation between
the two but adds extra complexity at development time. The main
idea, therefore, is that if you start with a monolith and down the line
you want to move to a microservices architecture, it’s essential to
design your software with modularity in mind. Otherwise, if the logic
is mixed, you will probably have to rewrite everything from scratch,
adding tons of development time, which translates into wasted
resources.
In summary, monolithic architectures offer simplicity and ease of
maintenance but at the cost of flexibility and scalability. At the same
time, microservices provide the agility to scale and innovate but
require more sophisticated management and operational practices.
Exploring the LLM Twin’s inference
pipeline deployment strategy

## Page 648

Now that we’ve understood all the design choices available for
implementing the deployment strategy of the LLM Twin’s inference
pipeline, let’s explore the concrete decisions we made to actualize it.
Our primary objective is to develop a chatbot that facilitates content
creation. To achieve this, we will process requests sequentially, with
a strong emphasis on low latency. This necessitates the selection of
an online real-time inference deployment architecture.
On the monolith versus microservice aspect, we will split the ML
service between a REST API server containing the business logic
and an LLM microservice optimized for running the given LLM. As
the LLM requires a powerful machine to run the inference, and we
can further optimize it with various engines to speed up the latency
and memory usage, it makes the most sense to go with the
microservice architecture. By doing so, we can quickly adapt the
infrastructure based on various LLM sizes. For example, if we run an
8B parameter model, the model can run on a single machine with a
Nivida A10G GPU after quantization. But if we want to run a 30B
model, we can upgrade to an Nvidia A100 GPU. Doing so allows us
to upgrade only the LLM microservice while keeping the REST API
untouched.
As illustrated in Figure 10.4, most business logic is centered around
RAG in our particular use case. Thus, we will perform RAG’s

## Page 649

retrieval and augmentation parts within the business microservice. It
will also include all the advanced RAG techniques presented in the
previous chapter to optimize the pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-
retrieval steps.
The LLM microservice is strictly optimized for the RAG generation
component. Ultimately, the business layer will send the prompt trace
consisting of the user query, prompt, answer, and other intermediary
steps to the prompt monitoring pipeline, which we will detail in
Chapter 11.
In summary, our approach involves implementing an online real-time
ML service using a microservice architecture, which effectively splits
the LLM and business logic into two distinct services.

## Page 650

Figure 10.4: Microservice deployment architecture of the LLM Twin’s
inference pipeline
Let’s review the interface of the inference pipeline, which is defined
by the feature/training/inference (FTI) architecture. For the pipeline
to run, it needs two things:

## Page 651

Real-time features used for RAG, generated by the feature
pipeline, which is queried from our online feature store, more
concretely from the Qdrant vector database (DB)
A fine-tuned LLM generated by the training pipeline, which is
pulled from our model registry
With that in mind, the flow of the ML service looks as follows, as
illustrated in Figure 10.4:
1. A user sends a query through an HTTP request.
2. The user’s input retrieves the proper context by leveraging the
advanced RAG retrieval module implemented in Chapter 4.
3. The user’s input and retrieved context are packed into the final
prompt using a dedicated prompt template.
4. The prompt is sent to the LLM microservice through an HTTP
request.
5. The business microservices wait for the generated answer.
6. After the answer is generated, it is sent to the prompt monitoring
pipeline along with the user’s input and other vital information to
monitor.
7. Ultimately, the generated answer is sent back to the user.
Now, let’s explore what tech stack we used to implement the
architecture presented in Figure 10.4. As we know, we use Qdrant
for the vector DB. We will leverage Hugging Face for the model

## Page 652

registry. By doing so, we can publicly share our model with everyone
who is testing the code from this book. Thus, you can easily use the
model we provided if you don’t want to run the training pipeline,
which can cost up to 100 dollars. As you can see, shareability and
accessibility are some of the most beautiful aspects of storing your
model in a model registry.
We will implement the business microservice in FastAPI because it’s
popular, easy to use, and fast. The LLM microservice will be
deployed on AWS SageMaker, where we will leverage SageMaker’s
integration with Hugging Face’s Deep Learning Containers (DLCs)
to deploy the model. We will discuss Hugging Face’s DLCs in the
next section, but intuitively, it is an inference engine used to optimize
LLMs at serving time. The prompt monitoring pipeline is
implemented using Comet, but we will look over that module only in
Chapter 11.
The SageMaker Inference deployment is composed of the following
components that we will show you how to implement:
SageMaker endpoint: An endpoint is a scalable and secure API
that SageMaker hosts to enable real-time predictions from
deployed models. It’s essentially the interface through which
applications interact with your model. Once deployed, an

## Page 653

application can make HTTP requests to the endpoint to receive
real-time predictions.
SageMaker model: In SageMaker, a model is an artifact that
results from training an algorithm. It contains the information
required to make predictions, including the weights and
computation logic. You can create multiple models and use them
in different configurations or for various predictions.
SageMaker configuration: This configuration specifies the
hardware and software set up to host the model. It defines the
resources required for the endpoint, such as the type and number
of ML compute instances. Endpoint configurations are used when
creating or updating an endpoint. They allow for flexibility in the
deployment and scalability of the hosted models.
SageMaker Inference component: This is the last piece of the
puzzle that connects the model and configuration to an endpoint.
You can deploy multiple models to an endpoint, each with its
resource configuration. Once deployed, models are easily
accessible via the InvokeEndpoint API in Python.
Together, these components create a robust infrastructure for
deploying and managing ML models in SageMaker, enabling
scalable, secure, and efficient real-time predictions.
Other popular cloud platforms offer the exact solutions. For example,
you have Azure OpenAI instead of Bedrock and Azure ML instead of

## Page 654

SageMaker on Azure. The list of ML deployment tools, such as
Hopsworks, Modal, Vertex AI, Seldon, BentoML, and many more, is
endless and will probably change. What is essential though is to
understand your use case requirements and find a tool that fits your
needs.
The training versus the inference pipeline
Understanding the nuances between the training and inference
pipelines is crucial before we deploy the inference pipeline. While it
might seem straightforward that the training pipeline is for training
and the inference pipeline is for inference, there are significant
differences that we need to grasp to comprehend the technical
aspects of our discussion fully.
One key difference lies in how data is handled and accessed within
each pipeline. During training, data is typically accessed from offline
storage in batch mode, optimized for throughput and ensuring data
lineage. For example, our LLM Twin architecture uses ZenML
artifacts to access, version, and track data fed to the training loop in
batches. In contrast, the inference pipeline requires an online DB
optimized for low latency. We will leverage the Qdrant vector DB to
grab the necessary context for RAG. In this context, the focus shifts
from data lineage and versioning to quick data access, ensuring a
seamless user experience. Additionally, the outputs of these

## Page 655

pipelines also differ significantly. The training pipeline outputs trained
model weights stored in the model registry. Meanwhile, the inference
pipeline outputs predictions served directly to the user.
Also, the infrastructure required for each pipeline is different. The
training pipeline demands more powerful machines equipped with as
many GPUs as possible. This is because training involves batching
data and holding all the necessary gradients in memory for
optimization steps, making it highly compute-intensive. More
computational power and VRAM allow larger batches (or
throughput), reducing training time and enabling more extensive
experimentation. On the other hand, the inference pipeline typically
requires less computation. Inference often involves passing a single
sample or smaller batches to the model without the need for
optimization steps.
Despite these differences, there is some overlap between the two
pipelines, particularly regarding preprocessing and post-processing
steps. Applying the same preprocessing and post-processing
functions and hyperparameters during training and inference is
crucial. Any discrepancies can lead to what is known as training-
serving skew, where the model’s performance during inference
deviates from its performance during training.
Deploying the LLM Twin service

## Page 656

The last step is implementing the architecture presented in the
previous section. More concretely, we will deploy the LLM
microservice using AWS SageMaker and the business microservice
using FastAPI. Within the business microservice, we will glue the
RAG logic written in Chapter 9 with our fine-tuned LLM Twin,
ultimately being able to test out the inference pipeline end to end.
Serving the ML model is one of the most critical steps in any ML
application’s life cycle, as users can only interact with our model
after this phase is completed. If the serving architecture isn’t
designed correctly or if the infrastructure isn’t working properly, it
doesn’t matter that you have implemented a powerful and excellent
model. As long as the user cannot appropriately interact with it, it has
near zero value from a business point of view. For example, if you
have the best code assistant on the market, but the latency to use it
is too high, or the API calls keep crashing, the user will probably
switch to a less performant code assistant that works faster and is
more stable.
Thus, in this section, we will show you how to:
Deploy our fined-tuned LLM Twin model to AWS SageMaker
Write an inference client to interact with the deployed model
Write the business service in FastAPI
Integrate our RAG logic with our fine-tuned LLM

## Page 657

Implement autoscaling rules for the LLM microservice
Implementing the LLM microservice using AWS
SageMaker
We aim to deploy the LLM Twin model, stored in Hugging Face’s
model registry, to Amazon SageMaker as an online real-time
inference endpoint. We will leverage Hugging Face’s specialized
inference container, known as the Hugging Face LLM DLC, to
deploy our LLM.
What are Hugging Face’s DLCs?
DLCs are specialized Docker images that come pre-loaded with
essential deep-learning frameworks and libraries, including popular
tools like transformers, datasets, and tokenizers from Hugging Face.
These containers are designed to simplify the process of training and
deploying models by eliminating the need for complex environment
setup and optimization. The Hugging Face Inference DLC, in
particular, includes a fully integrated serving stack, significantly
simplifying the deployment process and reducing the technical
expertise needed to serve deep learning models in production.
When it comes to serving models, the DLC is powered by the Text
Generation Inference (TGI) engine, made by Hugging Face:

## Page 658

https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-
inference.
TGI is an open-source solution for deploying and serving LLMs. It
offers high-performance text generation using tensor parallelism and
dynamic batching for the most popular open-source LLMs available
on Hugging Face, such as Mistral, Llama, and Falcon. To sum up,
the most powerful features the DLC image provides are:
Tensor parallelism, thus enhancing the computational efficiency
of model inference
Optimized transformers code for inference, leveraging flash-
attention to maximize performance across the most widely used
architectures: https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-
attention
Quantization with bitsandbytes that reduces the model size
while maintaining performance, making deployments more
efficient: https://github.com/bitsandbytes-
foundation/bitsandbytes
Continuous batching of incoming requests, thus improving
throughput by dynamically batching requests as they arrive
Accelerated weight loading by utilizing safetensors for faster
model initialization, reducing start-up time:
https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors

## Page 659

Token streaming that supports real-time interactions through
Server-Sent Events (SSE)
To summarize, our LLM Twin model will run inside DLC Docker
images, listening to requests, optimizing the LLM for inference, and
serving the results in real time. The DLC’s Docker images will be
hosted on AWS SageMaker under inference endpoints that can be
accessed through HTTP requests. With that in mind, let’s move on to
the implementation. We will start by deploying the LLM and then
writing a wrapper class to interact with the SageMaker Inference
endpoint.
Configuring SageMaker roles
The first step is to create the proper AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM) users and roles to access and deploy the
SageMaker infrastructure. AWS IAM controls who can authenticate
and what any actor has access to. You can create new users
(assigned to people) and new roles (assigned to other actors within
your infrastructure, such as EC2 VMs) through IAM.
The whole deployment process is automated. We will have to run a
few CLI commands, but first, ensure that you have correctly
configured the AWS_ACCESS_KEY , AWS_SECRET_KEY , and
AWS_REGION environmental variables in the .env file. At this step,
the easiest way is to use the credentials attached to an admin role

## Page 660

as, in the following steps, we will create a set of narrower IAM roles
used in the rest of the chapter.
After you configured your .env file, we have to:
1. Create an IAM user restricted to creating and deleting only the
resources we need for the deployment, such as SageMaker itself,
Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and S3. To make it, run the
following:
poetry poe create-sagemaker-role
This command will generate a JSON file called
sagemaker_user_credentials.json that contains a new AWS
access and secret key. From now on, we will use these credentials
to deploy everything related to SageMaker to ensure we modify only
the resources associated with SageMaker. Otherwise, we could
accidentally modify other AWS resources using an admin account,
resulting in additional costs or altering other existing projects. Thus,
having a narrow role only to your use case is good practice.
The last step is to take the new credentials from the JSON file and
update the AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY variables in
your .env file. You can check out the implementation at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-

## Page 661

Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/infrastructure/aws/r
oles/create_sagemaker_role.py.
2. Create an IAM execution role. We will attach this role to the
SageMaker deployment, empowering it to access other AWS
resources on our behalf. This is standard practice for cloud
deployments, as instead of authenticating every machine within
your credentials, you attach a role that allows them to access only
what is necessary from your infrastructure. In our case, we will
provide SageMaker access to AWS S3, CloudWatch, and ECR. To
create the role, run the following:
poetry poe create-sagemaker-execution-role
This command will generate a JSON file called
sagemaker_execution_role.json that contains the Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of the newly created role. The ARN is an ID
attached to any AWS resource to identify it across your cloud
infrastructure. Take the ARN value from the JSON file and update
the AWS_ARN_ROLE variable from your .env file with it. You can
check out the implementation at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-
Handbook/blob/main/llm_engineering/infrastructure/aws/r
oles/create_execution_role.py.

## Page 662

If you have issues, configure the AWS CLI with the
same AWS credentials as in the .env file and repeat
the process. Official documentation for installing the
AWS CLI:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userg
uide/install-cliv2.html.
By setting the IAM user and role in your .env file, we will
automatically load them in the settings Python object and use them
throughout the following steps. Now, let’s move on to the actual
deployment.
Deploying the LLM Twin model to
AWS SageMaker
The deployment of AWS SageMaker is fully automated through a set
of Python classes, which we will cover in this chapter. This section
aims to understand how we configure the SageMaker infrastructure
directly from Python. Thus, you don’t have to run everything step by
step, as in a standard tutorial, but only to understand the code.
We can initiate and finalize the entire SageMaker deployment using
a simple CLI command: poe deploy-inference-endpoint . This
command will initialize all the steps presented in Figure 10.5, except

## Page 663

for creating the SageMaker AWS IAMs we created and configured in
the previous step.
In this section, we will walk you through the code presented in Figure
10.5 that helps us fully automate the deployment process, starting
with the create_endpoint() function. Ultimately, we will test the
CLI command and check the AWS console to see whether the
deployment was successful. The SageMaker deployment code is
available at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/LLM-
Engineers-
Handbook/tree/main/llm_engineering/infrastructure/aws/d
eploy.

## Page 664

Figure 10.5: AWS SageMaker deployment steps
We will take a top-down approach to walk you through the
implementation, starting with the main function that deploys the LLM
Twin model to AWS SageMaker. In the function below, we first take
the latest version of the Docker DLC image using the

## Page 665

get_huggingface_llm_image_uri() function, which is later
passed to the deployment strategy class, along with an instance of
the resource manager and deployment service:
def create_endpoint(endpoint_type=EndpointType.INF
llm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri("hug
resource_manager = ResourceManager()
deployment_service = DeploymentService(resourc
SagemakerHuggingfaceStrategy(deployment_servic
role_arn=settings.ARN_ROLE,
llm_image=llm_image,
config=hugging_face_deploy_config,
endpoint_name=settings.SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_
endpoint_config_name=settings.SAGEMAKER_EN
gpu_instance_type=settings.GPU_INSTANCE_TY
resources=model_resource_config,
endpoint_type=endpoint_type,
)
We must review the three classes used in the create_endpoint()
function to fully understand the deployment process. Let’s start with
the ResourceManager class. The class begins with the initialization
method, establishing the connection to AWS SageMaker using
boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, which provides the necessary

## Page 666

functions to interact with various AWS services, including
SageMaker.
class ResourceManager:
def __init__(self) -> None:
self.sagemaker_client = boto3.client(
"sagemaker",
region_name=settings.AWS_REGION,
aws_access_key_id=settings.AWS_ACCESS_
aws_secret_access_key=settings.AWS_SEC
)
Next, we implement the endpoint_config_exists method,
checking whether a specific SageMaker endpoint configuration
exists:
def endpoint_config_exists(self, endpoint_conf
try:
self.sagemaker_client.describe_endpoin
logger.info(f"Endpoint configuration '
return True
except ClientError:
logger.info(f"Endpoint configuration '
return False

## Page 667

The class also includes the endpoint_exists method, which
checks the existence of a specific SageMaker endpoint:
def endpoint_exists(self, endpoint_name: str) -> b
try:
self.sagemaker_client.describe_endpoin
logger.info(f"Endpoint '{endpoint_name
return True
except self.sagemaker_client.exceptions.Re
logger.info(f"Endpoint '{endpoint_name
return False
Let’s move to the DeploymentService . Within the constructor, we
set up the sagemaker_client , which will interface with AWS
SageMaker and an instance of the ResourceManager class we
talked about earlier:
class DeploymentService:
def __init__(self, resource_manager):
self.sagemaker_client = boto3.client(
"sagemaker",
region_name=settings.AWS_REGION,
aws_access_key_id=settings.AWS_ACCESS_
aws_secret_access_key=settings.AWS_SEC
)

## Page 668

)
self.resource_manager = resource_manager
The deploy() method is the heart of the DeploymentService
class. This method orchestrates the entire process of deploying a
model to a SageMaker endpoint. It checks whether the necessary
configurations are already in place and, if not, it triggers the
deployment:
def deploy(
self,
role_arn: str,
llm_image: str,
config: dict,
endpoint_name: str,
endpoint_config_name: str,
gpu_instance_type: str,
resources: Optional[dict] = None,
endpoint_type: enum.Enum = EndpointType.MODEL_
) -> None:
try:
if self.resource_manager.endpoint_config_e
logger.info(f"Endpoint configuration {
else:
logger.info(f"Endpoint configuration{e
self.prepare_and_deploy_model(
role arn=role arn

## Page 669

role_arn=role_arn,
llm_image=llm_image,
config=config,
endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
update_endpoint=False,
resources=resources,
endpoint_type=endpoint_type,
gpu_instance_type=gpu_instance_type,
)
logger.info(f"Successfully deployed/update
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"Failed to deploy model to S
raise
The deploy method begins by checking whether the endpoint
configuration already exists using the resource_manager . This
step is crucial because it avoids unnecessary redeployment if the
configuration is already set up. The deployment itself is handled by
calling the prepare_and_deploy_model() method, which is
responsible for the actual deployment of the model to the specified
SageMaker endpoint.
The prepare_and_deploy_model() method is a static method
within the DeploymentService class. This method is focused on
setting up and deploying the Hugging Face model to SageMaker:

## Page 670

@staticmethod
def prepare_and_deploy_model(
role_arn: str,
llm_image: str,
config: dict,
endpoint_name: str,
update_endpoint: bool,
gpu_instance_type: str,
resources: Optional[dict] = None,
endpoint_type: enum.Enum = EndpointType.MODEL_
) -> None:
huggingface_model = HuggingFaceModel(
role=role_arn,
image_uri=llm_image,
env=config,
transformers_version="4.6",
pytorch_version="1.13",
py_version="py310",
)
huggingface_model.deploy(
instance_type=gpu_instance_type,
initial_instance_count=1,
endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
update_endpoint=update_endpoint,
resources=resources,
tags=[{"Key": "task", "Value": "model_task
endpoint_type=endpoint_type,
)

## Page 671

This method begins by creating an instance of HuggingFaceModel, a
specialized model class from SageMaker designed to handle
Hugging Face models. The constructor for HuggingFaceModel takes
several essential parameters, such as the role ARN (which gives
SageMaker the necessary permissions), the URI of the LLM DLC
Docker image, and the LLM configuration that specifies what LLM to
load from Hugging Face and its inference parameters, such as the
maximum total of tokens.
Once HuggingFaceModel is instantiated, the method deploys it to
SageMaker using the deploy function. This deployment process
involves specifying the type of instance used, the number of
instances, and whether to update an existing endpoint or create a
new one. The method also includes optional resources for more
complex deployments, such as the initial_instance_count
parameter for multi-model endpoints and tags for tracking and
categorization.
The last step is to walk you through the
SagemakerHuggingfaceStrategy class, which aggregates
everything we have shown. The class is initialized only with an
instance of a deployment service, such as the one shown above.

## Page 672

class SagemakerHuggingfaceStrategy(DeploymentStrat
def __init__(self, deployment_service):
self.deployment_service = deployment_service
The core functionality of the SagemakerHuggingfaceStrategy
class is encapsulated in its deploy() method. This method
orchestrates the deployment process, taking various parameters that
define how the Hugging Face model should be deployed to AWS
SageMaker:
def deploy(
self,
role_arn: str,
llm_image: str,
config: dict,
endpoint_name: str,
endpoint_config_name: str,
gpu_instance_type: str,
resources: Optional[dict] = None,
endpoint_type: enum.Enum = EndpointType.MODEL_
) -> None:
logger.info("Starting deployment using Sagemak
logger.info(
f"Deployment parameters: nb of replicas: {
)

## Page 673

The parameters passed into the method are crucial to the
deployment process:
role_arn : The AWS IAM role that provides permissions for the
SageMaker deployment.
llm_image : The URI of the DLC Docker image
config : A dictionary containing configuration settings for the
model environment.
endpoint_name and endpoint_config_name : Names for the
SageMaker endpoint and its configuration, respectively.
gpu_instance_type : The type of the GPU EC2 instances used
for the deployment.
resources : Optional resources dictionary used for multi-model
endpoint deployments.
endpoint_type : This can either be MODEL_BASED or
INFERENCE_COMPONENT , determining whether the endpoint
includes an inference component.
The method delegates the actual deployment process to the
deployment_service . This delegation is a critical aspect of the
strategy pattern, allowing for flexibility in how the deployment is
carried out without altering the high-level deployment logic.
try:
self.deployment_service.deploy(
role arn=role arn

## Page 674

role_arn=role_arn,
llm_image=llm_image,
config=config,
endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
endpoint_config_name=endpoint_config_name,
gpu_instance_type=gpu_instance_type,
resources=resources,
endpoint_type=endpoint_type,
)
logger.info("Deployment completed successfully
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"Error during deployment: {e}")
raise
Also, let’s review the resource configuration to understand the
infrastructure better. These resources are leveraged when setting up
multi-endpoint configurations that use multiple replicas to serve
clients while respecting the latency and throughput requirements of
the application. The ResourceRequirements object is initialized
with a dictionary that specifies various resource parameters. These
parameters include the number of replicas (copies) of the model to
be deployed, the number of GPUs required, the number of CPU
cores, and the memory allocation in megabytes. Each of these
parameters plays a crucial role in the performance and scalability of
the deployed model.

## Page 675

from sagemaker.compute_resource_requirements.resou
model_resource_config = ResourceRequirements(
requests={
"copies": settings.COPIES,
"num_accelerators": settings.GPUS
"num_cpus": settings.CPUS,
"memory": 5 * 1024
},
)
In the preceding snippet, ResourceRequirements is configured
with four key parameters:
copies: This parameter determines how many instances or
replicas of the model should be deployed. Having multiple replicas
can help in reducing latency and increasing throughput.
num_accelerators: This parameter specifies the number of
GPUs to allocate. Since LLMs are computationally intensive,
multiple GPUs are typically required to accelerate inference
processes.
num_cpus: This defines the number of CPU cores the
deployment should have. The number of CPUs impacts the
model’s ability to handle data preprocessing, post-processing, and
other tasks that are less GPU-dependent but still essential.

## Page 676

memory: The memory parameter sets the minimum amount of
RAM required for the deployment. Adequate memory is necessary
to ensure the model can load and operate without running into
memory shortages.
By setting these parameters, the class ensures that it has sufficient
resources to operate efficiently when the model is deployed to a
SageMaker endpoint. The precise tuning of these values will vary
depending on the LLM’s specific requirements, such as its size, the
complexity of the tasks it will perform, and the expected load. To get
a better understanding of how to use them, after deploying the
endpoint, we suggest modifying them and seeing how the
performance of the LLM microservice changes.
Ultimately, let’s review the settings configuring the LLM engine. The
HF_MODEL_ID identifies which Hugging Face model to deploy. For
example, in the settings class, we set it to mlabonne/TwinLlama-
3.1-8B-13 to load our custom LLM Twin model stored in Hugging
Face. SM_NUM_GPUS specifies the number of GPUs allocated per
model replica, which is crucial for fitting your model into the GPU’s
VRAM. HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN provides access to the Hugging
Face Hub for model retrieval. HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE specifies what
quantization technique to use, while the rest of the variables control
the LLM token generation process.
{

## Page 677

hugging_face_deploy_config = {
"HF_MODEL_ID": settings.HF_MODEL_ID,
"SM_NUM_GPUS": json.dumps(settings.SM_NUM_GPUS
"MAX_INPUT_LENGTH": json.dumps(settings.MAX_IN
"MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS": json.dumps(settings.MAX_TO
"MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS": json.dumps(settings.
"HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN": settings.HUGGINGFACE
"MAX_BATCH_PREFILL_TOKENS": "10000",
"HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE": "bitsandbytes",
}
Using these two configurations, we fully control our infrastructure,
what LLM to use, and how it behaves. To start the SageMaker
deployment with the configuration shown above, call the
create_endpoint() function (presented at the beginning of the
section) as follows:
create_endpoint(endpoint_type=EndpointType.MODEL_B
For convenience, we also wrapped it up under a poe command:
poetry poe deploy-inference-endpoint

## Page 678

That’s all you need to deploy an inference pipeline to AWS
SageMaker. The hardest part is finding the correct configuration to fit
your needs while reducing your infrastructure’s costs. Depending on
AWS, this will take up to 15-30 minutes to deploy. You can always
change any value directly from your .env file and deploy the model
with a different configuration without touching the code. For example,
our default values use a single GPU instance of type
ml.g5.xlargeGPU . If you want more replicas, you can tweak the
GPUS and SM_NUM_GPUS settings or change your instance type by
changing the GPU_INSTANCE_TYPE variable.
Before deploying the LLM microservice to AWS
SageMaker, ensure that you’ve generated a user role
by running poetry poe create-sagemaker-role
and an execution role by running poetry poe
create-sagemaker-execution-role . Also, ensure
you update your AWS_* environment variables in your
.env file with the credentials generated by the two
steps. You can find more details on this aspect in the
repository’s README file.
After deploying the AWS SageMaker Inference endpoint, you can
navigate to the SageMaker dashboard in AWS to visualize it. First, in
the left panel, click on SageMaker dashboard, and then in the

## Page 679

Inference column, click on the Endpoints button, as illustrated in
Figure 10.6.
Figure 10.6: AWS SageMaker Inference endpoints example
After clicking the Endpoints button, you will see your twin endpoint
in a Creating or Created status, as seen in Figure 10.7. After
clicking on it, you can look at the endpoint’s logs in CloudWatch and
monitor the CPU, memory, disk, and GPU utilization.
Also, they provide an excellent way to monitor all the HTTP errors,
such as 4XX and 5XX , in one place.

## Page 680

Figure 10.7: AWS SageMaker twin inference endpoint example
Calling the AWS SageMaker
Inference endpoint
Now that our LLM service has been deployed on AWS SageMaker,
let’s learn how to call the service. To do so, we will write two classes
that will help us prepare the prompt for SageMaker, call the inference
endpoint through HTTP requests, and decode the results in a way
the client can work with. All the AWS SageMaker Inference code is
available on GitHub at llm_engineering/model/inference . It all
starts with the following example:
text = "Write me a post about AWS SageMaker infere
llm = LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint(
endpoint_name=settings.SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_
)
Answer = InferenceExecutor(llm, text).execute()
As before, we will walk you through the
LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint and InferenceExecutor
classes. Let’s start with the LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint
class, which directly interacts with SageMaker. The constructor

## Page 681

initializes all the essential attributes necessary to interact with the
SageMaker endpoint:
class LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint(Inference):
def __init__(
self,
endpoint_name: str,
default_payload: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
inference_component_name: Optional[str] =
) -> None:
super().__init__()
self.client = boto3.client(
"sagemaker-runtime",
region_name=settings.AWS_REGION,
aws_access_key_id=settings.AWS_ACCESS_
aws_secret_access_key=settings.AWS_SEC
)
self.endpoint_name = endpoint_name
self.payload = default_payload if default_
self.inference_component_name = inference_
endpoint_name is crucial for identifying the SageMaker endpoint
we want to request. Additionally, the method initializes the payload
using a provided value or by calling a method that generates a
default payload if none is provided.

## Page 682

One of the key features of the class is its ability to generate a default
payload for inference requests. This is handled by the
_default_payload() method:
def _default_payload(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
return {
"inputs": "",
"parameters": {
"max_new_tokens": settings.MAX_NEW_TOK
"top_p": settings.TOP_P_INFERENCE,
"temperature": settings.TEMPERATURE_IN
"return_full_text": False,
},
}
This method returns a dictionary that represents the default structure
of the payload to be sent for inference. The parameters section
includes settings that influence the model’s behavior during
inference, such as the number of tokens to generate, the sampling
strategy ( top_p ), and the temperature setting, which controls
randomness in the output. These parameters are fetched from the
application’s settings, ensuring consistency across different
inference tasks.

## Page 683

The class allows customization of the payload through the
set_payload() method, which enables the user to modify the
inputs and parameters before sending an inference request:
def set_payload(self, inputs: str, parameters: Opt
self.payload["inputs"] = inputs
if parameters:
self.payload["parameters"].update(paramete
This method updates the inputs field of the payload with the new
input text provided by the user. Additionally, it allows for modifying
inference parameters if any are provided.
Ultimately, we leverage the inference() method to call the
SageMaker endpoint with the customized payload:
def inference(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
try:
logger.info("Inference request sent.")
invoke_args = {
"EndpointName": self.endpoint_name,
"ContentType": "application/json",
"Body": json.dumps(self.payload),
}
if self.inference_component_name not in ["
invoke args["InferenceComponentName"]

## Page 684

invoke_args[ InferenceComponentName ]
response = self.client.invoke_endpoint(**i
response_body = response["Body"].read().de
return json.loads(response_body)
except Exception:
logger.exception("SageMaker inference fail
raise
In this method, the inference method constructs the request to be
sent to the SageMaker endpoint. The method packages the payload
and other necessary details into a format SageMaker expects. If an
inference_component_name is specified, it is included in the
request, allowing for more granular control over the inference
process if needed. The request is sent using the
invoke_endpoint() function, and the response is read, decoded,
and returned as a JSON object.
Let’s understand how the InferenceExecutor uses the
LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint class we previously presented
to send HTTP requests to the AWS SageMaker endpoint.
The InferenceExecutor class begins with the constructor, which
inputs key parameters for calling the LLM. The llm parameter
accepts any instance that implements the Inference interface, such
as the LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint class, which is used to
perform the inference.

## Page 685

Also, it accepts the query parameter, which represents the user
input. Ultimately, it takes an optional context field if you want to do
RAG, and you can customize the prompt template. If no prompt
template is provided, it will default to a generic version that is not
specialized in any LLM:
class InferenceExecutor:
def __init__(
self,
llm: Inference,
query: str,
context: str | None = None,
prompt: str | None = None,
) -> None:
self.llm = llm
self.query = query
self.context = context if context else ""
if prompt is None:
self.prompt = """
You are a content creator. Write what the user
User query: {query}
Context: {context}
"""
else:
self.prompt = prompt

## Page 686

The execute() method is the key component of the
InferenceExecutor class. This method is responsible for actually
performing the inference. When execute is called, it prepares the
payload sent to the LLM by formatting the prompt with the user’s
query and context.
Then, it configures several parameters that influence the behavior of
the LLM, such as the maximum number of new tokens the model is
allowed to generate, a repetition penalty to discourage the model
from generating repetitive text, and the temperature setting that
controls the randomness of the output.
Once the payload and parameters are set, the method calls the
inference function from LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint and
waits for the generated answer:
def execute(self) -> str:
self.llm.set_payload(
inputs=self.prompt.format(query=self.query
parameters={
"max_new_tokens": settings.MAX_NEW_TOK
"repetition_penalty": 1.1,
"temperature": settings.TEMPERATURE_IN
},
)
answer = self llm inference()[0]["generated te

## Page 687

answer = self.llm.inference()[0][ generated_te
return answer
By making the inference through an object that implements the
Inference interface we decouple, we can easily inject other Inference
strategies and the LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint
implementation presented above without modifying different parts of
the code.
Running a test example is straightforward. Simply call the following
Python file, as shown below:
poetry run python -m llm_engineering.model.inferen
Also, for convenience, we wrap it under a poe command:
poetry poe test-sagemaker-endpoint
Now, we must understand how we implement the business
microservice using FastAPI. This microservice will send HTTP
requests to the LLM microservice defined above and call the RAG
retrieval module implemented in Chapter 9.

## Page 688

Building the business microservice using
FastAPI
To implement a simple FastAPI application that proves our
deployment strategy, we first have to define a FastAPI instance as
follows:
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
Next, we define the QueryRequest and QueryResponse classes
using Pydantic’s BaseModel . These classes represent the request
and response structure for the FastAPI endpoints:
class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
query: str
class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
answer: str
Now that we’ve defined our FastAPI components and have all the
SageMaker elements in place, let’s reiterate over the
call_llm_service() and rag() functions we’ve presented in
Chapter 9 and couldn’t run because we haven’t deployed our fine-
tuned LLM. Thus, as a refresher, the call_llm_service()

## Page 689

function wraps the inference logic used to call the SageMaker LLM
microservice:
def call_llm_service(query: str, context: str | No
llm = LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint(
endpoint_name=settings.SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_
)
answer = InferenceExecutor(llm, query, context
return answer
Next, we define the rag() function that implements all the RAG
business logic. To avoid repeating ourselves, check Chapter 9 for the
complete function explanation. What is important to highlight is that
the rag() function only implements the business steps required to
do RAG, which are CPU- and I/O-bounded. For example, the
ContextRetriever class makes API calls to OpenAI and Qdrant,
which are network I/O bounded, and calls the embedding model,
which runs directly on the CPU. Also, as the LLM inference logic is
moved to a different microservice, the call_llm_service()
function is only network I/O bounded. To conclude, the whole
function is light to run, where the heavy computing is done on other
services, which allows us to host the FastAPI server on a light and
cheap machine that doesn’t need a GPU to run at low latencies:

## Page 690

def rag(query: str) -> str:
retriever = ContextRetriever(mock=False)
documents = retriever.search(query, k=3 * 3)
context = EmbeddedChunk.to_context(documents)
answer = call_llm_service(query, context)
return answer
Ultimately, we define the rag_endpoint() function, used to expose
our RAG logic over the internet as an HTTP endpoint. We use a
Python decorator to expose it as a POST endpoint in the FastAPI
application. This endpoint is mapped to the /rag route and expects
a QueryRequest as input. The function processes the request by
calling the rag function with the user’s query. If successful, it returns
the answer wrapped in a QueryResponse object. If an exception
occurs, it raises an HTTP 500 error with the exception details:
@app.post("/rag", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def rag_endpoint(request: QueryRequest):
try:
answer = rag(query=request.query)
return {"answer": answer}
except Exception as e:
raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detai

## Page 691

This FastAPI application demonstrates how to effectively integrate
an LLM hosted on AWS SageMaker into a web service, utilizing RAG
to enhance the relevance of the model’s responses. The code’s
modular design, leveraging custom classes like
ContextRetriever , InferenceExecutor , and
LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint , allows for easy customization
and scalability, making it a powerful tool for deploying ML models in
production environments.
We will leverage the uvicorn web server, the go-to method for
FastAPI applications, to start the server. To do so, you have to run
the following:
uvicorn tools.ml_service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port
Also, you can run the following poe command to achieve the same:
poetry poe run-inference-ml-service
To call the /rag endpoint, we can leverage the curl CLI
command to make a POST HTTP request to our FastAPI server, as
follows:

## Page 692

curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/rag' -H 'Conte
As usual, we provided an example using a poe command that
contains an actual user query:
poetry poe call-inference-ml-service
This FastAPI server runs only locally. The next step would be to
deploy it to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), a self-hosted
version of Kubernetes by AWS. Another option would be to deploy it
to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), which is similar to AWS
EKS but doesn’t use Kubernetes under the hood but AWS’s
implementation. Unfortunately, this is not specific to LLMs or
LLMOps. Hence, we won’t go through these steps in this book. But
to get an idea of what you must do, you must create an AWS
EKS/ECS cluster from the dashboard or leverage an infrastructure-
as-code (IaC) tool such as Terraform. After that, you will have to
Dockerize the FastAPI code presented above. Ultimately, you would
have to push the Docker image to AWS ECR and create an
ECS/EKR deployment using the Docker image hosted on ECR. If
this sounds like a lot, the good news is that we will walk you through
a similar example in Chapter 11, where we will deploy the ZenML
pipelines to AWS.

## Page 693

Once you’re done testing your inference pipeline
deployment, deleting all your AWS SageMaker
resources used to deploy the LLM is essential. As
almost all AWS resources use a pay-as-you-go
strategy, using SageMaker for a few hours wouldn’t
break your wallet, but if you forget and leave it open, in
a few days, the costs can grow exponentially. Thus, a
good rule of thumb is to always delete everything after
you’re done testing your SageMaker infrastructure (or
any AWS resource). Luckily, we have provided a script
that deletes all the AWS SageMaker resources for you:
poetry poe delete-inference-endpoint
To ensure everything was correctly deleted, go to your
SageMaker dashboard and check it yourself.
Autoscaling capabilities to handle
spikes in usage
So far, the SageMaker LLM microservice has used a static number
of replicas to serve our users, which means that all the time,
regardless of the traffic, it has the same number of instances up and
running. As we highlighted throughout this book, machines with

## Page 694

GPUs are expensive. Thus, we lose a lot of money during downtime
when most replicas are idle. Also, if our application has sudden
spikes in traffic, the application will perform poorly as the server
cannot handle the number of requests. This is a massive problem for
the user experience of our application, as in those spikes, we bring
in the majority of new users. Thus, if they have a terrible impression
of our product, we significantly reduce their chance of returning to
our platform.
Previously, we configured our multi-endpoint service using the
ResourceRequirements class from SageMaker. For example, let’s
assume we requested four copies (replicas) with the following
compute requirements:
model_resource_config = ResourceRequirements(
requests={
"copies": 4, # Number of replicas.
"num_accelerators": 4, # Number of GPUs re
"num_cpus": 8, # Number of CPU cores requi
"memory": 5 * 1024, # Minimum memory requ
},
)
Using this configuration, we always have four replicas serving the
clients, regardless of idle time or spikes in traffic. The solution is to

## Page 695

implement an autoscaling strategy that scales the number of replicas
up and down dynamically based on various metrics, such as the
number of requests.
For example, Figure 10.8 shows a standard architecture where the
SageMaker Inference endpoints scale in and out based on the
number of requests. When there is no traffic, we can have one online
replica so the server remains responsive to new user requests or
even scales down to zero if the latency is not super critical. Then,
let’s assume that when we have around 10 requests per second, we
have to keep two replicas online, and when the number of requests
spikes to 100 per second, the autoscaling service should spin up to
20 replicas to keep up with the demand. Note that these are fictional
numbers that should be adapted to your specific use case.

## Page 696

Figure 10.8: Autoscaling possible use cases
Without going into the little details of cloud networking, when working
with multi-replica systems, between the client and the replicas sits an
Application Load Balancer (ALB) or another type of load balancer.

## Page 697

All the requests first go to the ALB, which knows to route them to a
replica. The ALB can adopt various routing strategies, where the
simplest one is called round robin, which sequentially sends a
request to each replica. For example, the first request is routed to
replica one, the second to replica two, and so on. Taking this
approach, regardless of how many replicas you have online, the
endpoint that the client calls is always represented by the load
balancer that acts as an entry point into your cluster. Thus, adding or
removing new replicas doesn’t affect the server and client
communication protocol.
Let’s quickly learn how to implement an autoscaling strategy for our
AWS SageMaker Inference endpoint. SageMaker provides a feature
called Application Auto Scaling that allows you to scale resources
dynamically based on pre-defined policies. Two foundational steps
are involved in effectively leveraging this functionality: registering a
scalable target and creating a scalable policy.
Registering a scalable target
The first step in enabling autoscaling for your resources is to register
a scalable target with the Application Auto Scaling feature AWS
provides. Think of this as informing AWS about the specific resource
you intend to scale, as well as setting the boundaries within which

## Page 698

the scaling should occur. However, this step does not dictate how or
when the scaling should happen.
For instance, when working with SageMaker Inference components,
you’ll define the following:
Resource ID: This serves as a unique identifier for the resource
you want to scale, typically including the name of the SageMaker
Inference component.
Service namespace: This identifies the AWS service the
resource belongs to, which, in this case, is SageMaker.
Scalable dimension: This specifies the resources to be scaled,
such as the desired number of copies.
MinCapacity and MaxCapacity: These parameters define the
boundaries of the autoscaling strategies, such as minimum and
maximum limits of the number of replicas.
By registering a scalable target, you prepare your SageMaker
Inference component for future scaling actions without determining
when or how these actions should occur.
Creating a scalable policy
Once your scalable target is registered, the next step is defining how
the scaling should occur. This is where creating a scaling policy
comes in. A scaling policy defines specific rules that trigger scaling

## Page 699

events. When creating policies, you have to define metrics to know
what to monitor and thresholds to know when to emit scaling events.
In the context of our SageMaker Inference component, the scalable
policy might include the following elements:
Policy type: For instance, you might select
TargetTrackingScaling, a policy that adjusts the resource’s
capacity to maintain a specific target value for a chosen metric.
Target tracking configuration: This involves selecting the metric
to monitor (such as
SageMakerInferenceComponentInvocationsPerCopy), setting the
desired target value, and specifying cooldown periods that control
how quickly scaling actions can occur after previous ones.
The scaling policy defines the rules for your scaling-in and scaling-
out strategy. It constantly monitors the specified metric, and
depending on whether the metric exceeds or falls below the target
value, it triggers actions to scale the number of inference component
copies up or down, always within the limits defined by the registered
scalable target.
Let’s explain in more depth how the TargetTrackingScaling policy
works. Imagine you have a metric that represents the ideal average
utilization or throughput level for your application. With target

## Page 700

tracking, you select this metric and set a target value that reflects the
optimal state for your application. Once defined, Application Auto
Scaling creates and manages the necessary CloudWatch alarms to
monitor this metric. When deviations occur, scaling actions are
triggered, similar to how a thermostat adjusts to maintain a
consistent room temperature.
For instance, consider an application running on SageMaker. Let’s
assume we set a target of keeping GPU utilization around 70
percent. This target allows you to maintain enough headroom to
manage sudden traffic spikes while preventing the unnecessary cost
of idle resources. When GPU usage exceeds the target, the system
scales out, adding resources to manage the increased load.
Conversely, when GPU usage drops below the target, the system
scales in, reducing capacity to minimize costs during quieter periods.
One significant advantage of setting up target tracking policies using
Application Auto Scaling is that they simplify the scaling process. You
no longer need to configure CloudWatch alarms and define scaling
adjustments manually.
Minimum and maximum scaling limits
When setting up autoscaling for your SageMaker Inference
endpoints, it’s crucial to establish your maximum and minimum

## Page 701

scaling limits before creating your scaling policy. The minimum value
represents the least resources your model can operate with. This
value must be at least 1, ensuring that your model always has some
capacity.
Next, configure the maximum value, which defines the upper limit of
resources your model can scale up to. While the maximum must be
equal to or greater than the minimum value, it doesn’t impose any
upper limit. Thus, you can scale up as much as your application
needs within the boundaries of what AWS can provide.
Cooldown period
Another important aspect of a scaling policy is the cooldown period,
during which it’s crucial to maintain a balance between
responsiveness and stability. This cooldown period acts as a
safeguard, ensuring that your system doesn’t overreact during
scaling events—whether it’s reducing capacity (scaling in) or
increasing it (scaling out). By introducing a calculated pause, the
cooldown period prevents rapid fluctuations in the number of
instances. Specifically, it delays the removal of instances during
scale-in requests and restricts the creation of new replicas during
scale-out requests. This strategy helps maintain a stable and
efficient environment for LLM service.

## Page 702

These practical basics are used in autoscaling most web servers,
including online real-time ML servers. Once you understand how to
configure scaling policies for SageMaker, you can immediately apply
the strategies you’ve learned to other popular deployment tools like
Kubernetes or AWS ECS.
For a step-by-step guideline on how to configure
autoscaling for the AWS SagaMaker endpoint
implemented in this chapter, you can follow this official
tutorial from AWS:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest
/dg/endpoint-auto-scaling-prerequisites.html.
Autoscaling is a critical component in any cloud architecture, but
there are some pitfalls you should be aware of. The first and most
dangerous one is over-scaling, which directly impacts the costs of
your infrastructure. If your scaling policy or cooldown period is too
sensitive, you may be uselessly spinning up new machines that will
remain idle or with the resources underused. The second reason is
on the other side of the spectrum, where your system doesn’t scale
enough, resulting in a bad user experience for the end user.
That’s why a good practice is to understand the requirements of your
system. Based on them, you should tweak and experiment with the
autoscaling parameters in a dev or test environment until you find

## Page 703

the sweet spot (similar to hyperparameter tuning when training
models). Let’s suppose, for instance, that you expect your system to
support an average of 100 users per minute and scale up to 10,000
users per minute in case of an outlier event such as a holiday. Using
this spec, you can stress test your system and monitor your
resources to find the best trade-off between costs, latency, and
throughput that supports standard and outlier use cases.
Summary
In this chapter, we learned what design decisions to make before
serving an ML model, whether an LLM or not, by walking you
through the three fundamental deployment types for ML models:
online real-time inference, asynchronous inference, and offline batch
transform. Then, we considered whether building our ML-serving
service as a monolith application made sense or splitting it into two
microservices, such as an LLM microservice and a business
microservice. To do this, we weighed the pros and cons of a
monolithic versus microservices architecture in model-serving.
Next, we walked you through deploying our fine-tuned LLM Twin to
an AWS SageMaker Inference endpoint. We also saw how to
implement the business microservice using FastAPI, which consists
of all the RAG steps based on the retrieval module implemented in
Chapter 9 and the LLM microservice deployed on AWS SageMaker.

## Page 704

Ultimately, we explored why we have to implement an autoscaling
strategy. We also reviewed a popular autoscaling strategy that
scales in and out based on a given set of metrics and saw how to
implement it in AWS SageMaker.
In the next chapter, we will learn about the fundamentals of MLOps
and LLMOps and then explore how to deploy the ZenML pipelines to
AWS and implement a continuous training, continuous
integration, and continuous delivery (CT/CI/CD) and monitoring
pipeline.

MLOps and LLMOps
Throughout the book, we’ve already used machine learning
operations (MLOps) components and principles such as a model
registry to share and version our fined-tuned large language
models (LLMs), a logical feature store for our fine-tuning and RAG
data, and an orchestrator to glue all our ML pipelines together. But
MLOps is not just about these components; it takes an ML
application to the next level by automating data collection, training,
testing, and deployment. Thus, the end goal of MLOps is to
automate as much as possible and let users focus on the most
critical decisions, such as when a change in distribution is detected
and a decision must be taken on whether it is essential to retrain the
model or not. But what about LLM operations (LLMOps)? How
does it differ from MLOps?
The term LLMOps is a product of the widespread adoption of LLMs.
It is built on top of MLOps, which is built on top of development
operations (DevOps). Thus, to fully understand what LLMOps is
about, we must provide a historical context, starting with DevOps
and building on the term from there—which is precisely what this
chapter will do. At its core, LLMOps focuses on problems specific to
LLMs, such as prompt monitoring and versioning, input and output

## Page 708

guardrails to prevent toxic behavior, and feedback loops to gather
fine-tuning data. It also focuses on scaling issues that appear when
working with LLMs, such as collecting trillions of tokens for training
datasets, training models on massive GPU clusters, and reducing
infrastructure costs. Fortunately for the common folk, these issues
are solved mainly by a few companies that fine-tune foundational
models, such as Meta, which provides the Llama family of models.
Most companies will adopt these pre-trained foundational models for
their use cases, focusing on LLMOps problems such as prompt
monitoring and versioning.
On the implementation side of things, to add LLMOps to our LLM
Twin use case, we will deploy all our ZenML pipelines to AWS. We
will implement a continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to test the integrity of our code and
automate the deployment process, a continuous training (CT)
pipeline to automate our training, and a monitoring pipeline to track
all our prompts and generated answers. This is a natural progression
in any ML project, regardless of whether you use LLMs.
In previous chapters, you learned how to build an LLM application.
Now, it’s time to explore three main goals related to LLMOps. The
first one is to gain a theoretical understanding of LLMOps, starting
with DevOps, then moving to the fundamental principles of MLOps,
and finally, digging into LLMOps. We don’t aim to provide the whole

## Page 709

theory on DevOps, MLOps, and LLMOps, as you could easily write
an entire book on these topics. However, we want to build a strong
understanding of why we make certain decisions when implementing
the LLM Twin use case.
Our second goal is to deploy the ZenML pipelines to AWS (currently,
we’ve deployed only our inference pipeline to AWS in Chapter 10).
This section will be hands-on, showing you how to leverage ZenML
to deploy everything to AWS. We need this to implement our third
and last goal, which is to apply what we’ve learned in the theory
section to our LLM Twin use case. We will implement a CI/CD
pipeline using GitHub Actions, a CT and alerting pipeline using
ZenML, and a monitoring pipeline using Opik from Comet ML.
Thus, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
The path to LLMOps: Understanding its roots in DevOps and
MLOps
Deploying the LLM Twin’s pipelines to the cloud
Adding LLMOps to the LLM Twin
The path to LLMOps: Understanding
its roots in DevOps and MLOps

## Page 710

To understand LLMOps, we have to start with the field’s beginning,
which is DevOps, as it inherits most of its fundamental principles
from there. Then, we will move to MLOps to understand how the
DevOps domain was adapted to support ML systems. Finally, we will
explain what LLMOps is and how it emerged from MLOps after the
widespread adoption of LLMs.
DevOps
Manually shipping software is time-consuming, error-prone, involves
security risks, and doesn’t scale. Thus, DevOps was born to
automate the process of shipping software at scale. More
specifically, DevOps is used in software development, where you
want to completely automate your building, testing, deploying, and
monitoring components. It is a methodology designed to shorten the
development lifecycle and ensure continuous delivery of high-quality
software. It encourages collaboration, automates processes,
integrates workflows, and implements rapid feedback loops. These
elements contribute to a culture where building, testing, and
releasing software becomes more reliable and faster.
Embracing a DevOps culture offers significant advantages to an
organization, primarily boosting operational efficiency, speeding up
feature delivery, and enhancing product quality. Some of the main
benefits include:

## Page 711

Improved collaboration: DevOps is pivotal in creating a more
unified working environment. Eliminating the barriers between
development and operations teams fosters enhanced
communication and teamwork, leading to a more efficient and
productive workplace.
Boosted efficiency: Automating the software development
lifecycle reduces manual tasks, errors, and delivery times.
Ongoing improvement: DevOps is not just about internal
processes. It’s about ensuring that the software effectively meets
user needs. Promoting a culture of continuous feedback enables
teams to quickly adapt and enhance their processes, thereby
delivering software that genuinely satisfies the end users.
Superior quality and security: DevOps ensures swift software
development while maintaining high quality and security
standards through CI/CD and proactive security measures.
The DevOps lifecycle
As illustrated in Figure 11.1, the DevOps lifecycle encompasses the
entire journey from the inception of software development to its
delivery, upkeep, and security. The key stages of this lifecycle are:
1. Plan: Organize and prioritize the tasks, ensuring each is tracked
to completion.

## Page 712

2. Code: Collaborate with your team to write, design, develop, and
securely manage code and project data.
3. Build: Package your applications and dependencies into an
executable format.
4. Test: This stage is crucial. It’s where you confirm that your code
functions correctly and meets quality standards, ideally through
automated testing.
5. Release: If the tests pass, flag the tested build as a new release,
which is now ready to be shipped.
6. Deploy: Deploy the latest release to the end users.
7. Operate: Manage and maintain the infrastructure on which the
software runs effectively once it is live. This involves scaling,
security, data management, and backup and recovery.
8. Monitor: Track performance metrics and errors to reduce the
severity and frequency of incidents.

## Page 713

Figure 11.1: DevOps lifecycle steps
The core DevOps concepts
DevOps encompasses various practices throughout the application
lifecycle, but the core ones that we will touch on throughout this book
are:
Deployment environments: To thoroughly test your code before
shipping it to production, you must define multiple pre-production
environments that mimic the production one. The most common
approach is to create a dev environment where the developers
can test their latest features. Then, you have a staging
environment where the QA team and stakeholders tinker with the
application to find bugs and experience the latest features before
they ship to the users. Lastly, we have the production
environment, which is exposed to end users.
Version control: Used to track, manage, and version every
change made to the source code. This allows you to have
complete control over the evolution of the code and deployment
processes. For example, without versioning, tracking changes
between the dev, staging, and production environments would be
impossible. By versioning your software, you always know what
version is stable and ready to be shipped.

## Page 714

Continuous integration (CI): Before pushing the code into the
dev, staging, and production main branches, you automatically
build your application and run automated tests on each change.
After all the automated tests pass, the feature branch can be
merged into the main one.
Continuous delivery (CD): Continuous delivery works in
conjunction with CI and automates the infrastructure provisioning
and application deployment steps. For example, after the code is
merged into the staging environment, the application with the
latest changes will be automatically deployed on top of your
staging infrastructure. After, the QA team (or stakeholders) starts
manually testing the latest features to verify that they work as
expected. These two steps are commonly referred to together as
CI/CD.
Note that DevOps suggests a set of core principles that are
platform/tool agnostic. However, within our LLM Twin use case, we
will add a version control layer using GitHub, which aims to track the
evolution of the code. Another popular tool for version control is
GitLab. To implement the CI/CD pipeline, we will leverage the GitHub
ecosystem and GitHub Actions, which are free for open-source
projects. Other tool choices are GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and Jenkins.
Usually, you pick the DevOps tool based on your development
environment, customization, and privacy needs. For example,
Jenkins is an open-source DevOps tool you can host yourself and

## Page 715

control fully. The downside is that you must host and maintain it
yourself, adding a complexity layer. Thus, many companies choose
what works best with their version control ecosystem, such as
GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
Now that we’ve established a solid understanding of DevOps, let’s
explore how the MLOps field has emerged to keep these same core
principles in the AI/ML world.
MLOps
As you might have worked out by now, MLOps tries to apply the
DevOps principles to ML. The core issue is that an ML application
has many other moving parts compared to a standard software
application, such as the data, model, and, finally, the code. MLOps
aims to track, operationalize, and monitor all these concepts for
better reproducibility, robustness, and control.
In ML systems, a build can be triggered by any change in these
areas—whether it’s an update in the code, modifications in the data,
or adjustments to the model.

## Page 716

Figure 11.2: Relationship between data, model, and code changes
In DevOps, everything is centered around the code. For example,
when a new feature is added to the codebase, you have to trigger
the CI/CD pipeline. In MLOps, the code can remain unchanged while
only the data changes. In that case, you must train (or fine-tune) a
new model, resulting in a new dataset and model version. Intuitively,
when one component changes, it affects one or more of the others.

## Page 717

Thus, MLOps has to take into consideration all this extra complexity.
Here are a few examples that can trigger a change in the data and
indirectly in the model:
After deploying the ML model, its performance might decay as
time passes, so we need new data to retrain it.
After understanding how to collect data in the real world, we might
recognize that getting the data for our problem is challenging, so
we need to re-formulate it to work with our real-world setup.
While in the experimentation stage and training the model, we
often must collect more data or re-label it, which generates a new
set of models.
After serving the model in the production environment and
collecting feedback from the end users, we might recognize that
the assumptions we made for training the model are wrong, so we
must change our model.
So, what is MLOps?
A more official definition of MLOps is the following: MLOps is the
extension of the DevOps field that makes data and models their first-
class citizen while preserving the DevOps methodology.
Like DevOps, MLOps originates from the idea that isolating ML
model development from its deployment process (ML operations)

## Page 718

diminishes the system’s overall quality, transparency, and agility.
With that in mind, an optimal MLOps experience treats ML assets
consistently as other software assets within a CI/CD environment as
part of a cohesive release process.
MLOps core components
We have already used all of these components throughout the book,
but let’s have a quick refresher on the MLOps core components now
that we better understand the field. Along with source control and
CI/CD, MLOps revolves around:
Model registry: A centralized repository for storing trained ML
models (tools: Comet ML, W&B, MLflow, ZenML)
Feature store: Preprocessing and storing input data as features
for both model training and inference pipelines (tools:
Hopsworks, Tecton, Featureform)
ML metadata store: This store tracks information related to
model training, such as model configurations, training data,
testing data, and performance metrics. It is mainly used to
compare multiple models and look at the model lineages to
understand how they were created (tools: Comet ML, W&B,
MLflow)
ML pipeline orchestrator: Automating the sequence of steps in
ML projects (tools: ZenML, Airflow, Prefect, Dagster)

## Page 719

You might have noticed an overlap between the MLOps components
and its specific tooling. This is common, as most MLOps tools offer
unified solutions, often called MLOps platforms.
MLOps principles
Six core principles guide the MLOps field. These are independent of
any tool and sit at the core of building robust and scalable ML
systems.
They are:
Automation or operationalization: Automation in MLOps
involves transitioning from manual processes to automated
pipelines through CT and CI/CD. This enables the efficient
retraining and deployment of ML models in response to triggers
such as new data, performance drops, or unhandled edge cases.
Moving from manual experimentation to full automation ensures
that our ML systems are robust, scalable, and adaptable to
changing requirements without errors or delays.
Versioning: In MLOps, it is crucial to track changes in code,
models, and data individually, ensuring consistency and
reproducibility. Code is tracked using tools like Git, models are
versioned through model registries, and data versioning can be
managed using solutions like DVC or artifact management
systems.

## Page 720

Experiment tracking: As training ML models is an iterative and
experimental process that involves comparing multiple
experiments based on predefined metrics, using an experiment
tracker to help us pick the best model is important. Tools like
Comet ML, W&B, MLflow, and Neptune allow us to log all
necessary information to compare experiments easily and select
the best model for production.
Testing: MLOps suggests that along with testing your code, you
should also test your data and models through unit, integration,
acceptance, regression, and stress tests. This ensures that each
component functions correctly and integrates well, focusing on
inputs, outputs, and handling edge cases.
Monitoring: This stage is vital for detecting performance
degradation in served ML models due to changes in production
data, allowing timely intervention such as retraining, further
prompt or feature engineering, or data validation. By tracking logs,
system metrics, and model metrics and detecting drifts, we can
maintain the health of ML systems in production, detect issues as
fast as possible, and ensure they continue to deliver accurate
results.
Reproducibility: This ensures that every process (such as
training or feature engineering) within your ML systems produces
identical results when given the same input by tracking all the
moving variables, such as code versions, data versions,

## Page 721

hyperparameters, or any other type of configurations. Due to the
non-deterministic nature of ML training and inference, setting well-
known seeds when generating pseudo-random numbers is
essential to achieving consistent outcomes and making processes
as deterministic as possible.
If you want to learn more, we’ve offered an in-depth exploration of
these principles in the Appendix at the end of this book.
ML vs. MLOps engineering
There is a fine line between ML engineering and MLOps. If we want
to define a rigid job description for the two rules, it cannot be easy to
completely differentiate what responsibilities go into ML engineering
(MLE) and what goes into MLOps. I have seen many job roles that
bucket the MLOps role with the platform and cloud engineers. From
one perspective, that makes a lot of sense: as an MLOps engineer,
you have a lot of work to do on the infrastructure side. On the other
hand, as seen in this section, an MLOps engineer still has to
implement things such as experiment tracking, model registries,
versioning, and more. A good strategy would be to let the ML
engineer integrate these into the code and the MLOps engineer
focus on making them work on their infrastructure.
At a big corporation, ultimately, differentiating the two roles might
make sense. But when working in small to medium-sized teams, you

## Page 722

will wear multiple hats and probably work on the ML system’s MLE
and MLOps aspects.
Figure 11.3: DS vs. MLE vs. MLOps
For instance, in Figure 11.3, we see a clear division of
responsibilities among the three key roles: data scientist/ML
researcher, ML engineer, and MLOps engineer. The Data Scientist
(DS) implements specific models to address problems.

## Page 723

The ML engineer takes the functional models from the DS team and
constructs a layer on top of them, making them modular and
extendable and providing access to a database (DB) or exposing
them as an API over the internet. However, the MLOps engineer
plays a pivotal role in this process. They take the code from this
intermediate layer and place it on a more generic layer, the
infrastructure. This action marks the application’s transition to
production. From this point, we can start thinking about automation,
monitoring, versioning, and more.
The intermediate layer differentiates a proof of concept from an
actual product. In that layer, you design an extendable application
that has a state by integrating a DB and is accessible over the
internet through an API. When shipping the application on a specific
infrastructure, you must consider scalability, latency, and cost-
effectiveness. Of course, the intermediate and generic layers depend
on each other, and often, you must reiterate to meet the application
requirements.
LLMOps
LLMOps encompasses the practices and processes essential for
managing and running LLMs. This field is a specialized branch of
MLOps, concentrating on the unique challenges and demands
associated with LLMs. While MLOps addresses the principles and

## Page 724

practices of managing various ML models, LLMOps focuses on the
distinct aspects of LLMs, including their large size, highly complex
training requirements, prompt management, and non-deterministic
nature of generating answers. However, note that at its core,
LLMOps still inherits all the fundamentals presented in the MLOps
section. Thus, here, we will focus on what it adds on top.
When training LLMs from scratch, the data and model dimensions of
an ML system grow substantially, which is one aspect that sets
LLMOps apart from MLOps. These are the main concerns when
training LLMs from scratch:
Data collection and preparation involves collecting, preparing,
and managing the massive datasets required for training LLMs. It
involves big data techniques for processing, storing, and sharing
training datasets. For example, GPT-4 was trained on roughly 13
trillion tokens, equal to approximately 10 trillion words.
Managing LLMs’ considerable number of parameters is a
significant technical challenge from the infrastructure’s point of
view. It requires vast computation resources, usually clusters of
machines powered by Nvidia GPUs with CUDA support.
The massive size of LLMs directly impacts model training. When
training an LLM from scratch, you can’t fit it on a single GPU due
to the model’s size or the higher batch size you require for the
expected results. Thus, you need multi-GPU training, which

## Page 725

involves optimizing your processes and infrastructure to support
data, model, or tensor parallelism.
Managing massive datasets and multi-GPU clusters involves
substantial costs. For example, the estimated training cost for
GPT-4 is around $100 million, as stated by Sam Altman, the CEO
of OpenAI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-
4#Training). Add to that the costs of multiple experiments,
evaluation, and inference. Even if these numbers are not exact,
as the sources are not 100% reliable, the scale of the costs of
training an LLM is trustworthy, which implies that only the large
players in the industry can afford to train LLMs from scratch.
At its core, LLMOps is MLOps at scale. It uses the same MLOps
principles but is applied to big data and huge models that require
more computing power to train and run. However, due to its huge
scale, the most significant trend is the shift away from training neural
networks from scratch for specific tasks. This approach is becoming
obsolete with the rise of fine-tuning, especially with the advent of
foundation models such as GPT. A few organizations with extensive
computational resources, such as OpenAI and Google, develop
these foundation models. Thus, most applications now rely on the
lightweight fine-tuning of parts of these models, prompt engineering,
or optionally distilling data or models into smaller, specialized
inference networks.

## Page 726

Thus, for most LLM applications out there, your development steps
will involve the selection of a foundation model, which you further
have to optimize by using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or RAG.
Thus, the operational aspect of these three steps is the most critical
to understand. Let’s dive into some popular components of LLMOps
that can improve prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and RAG.
Human feedback
One valuable refinement step of your LLM is aligning it with your
audience’s preferences. You must introduce a feedback loop within
your application and gather a human feedback dataset to further
fine-tune the LLM with techniques such as Reinforcement Learning
with Human Feedback (RLHF) or more advanced ones such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). One popular feedback loop
is the thumbs-up/thumbs-down button present in most chatbot
interfaces. You can read more on preference alignment in Chapter 6.
Guardrails
Unfortunately, LLM systems are not reliable, as they often
hallucinate. You can optimize your system against hallucinations, but
as hallucinations are hard to detect and can take many forms, there
are significant changes that will still happen in the future.

## Page 727

Most users have accepted this phenomenon, but what is not
acceptable is when LLMs accidentally output sensitive information,
such as GitHub Copilot outputting AWS secret keys or other chatbots
providing people’s passwords. This can also happen with people’s
phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, and more. Ideally, you
should remove all this sensitive data from your training data so the
LLM doesn’t memorize it, but that doesn’t always happen.
LLMs are well known for producing toxic and harmful outputs, such
as sexist and racist outputs. For example, during an experiment on
ChatGPT around April 2023, people found how to hijack the system
by forcing the chatbot to adopt a negative persona, such as “a bad
person” or “a horrible person.” It worked even by forcing the chatbot
to play the role of well-known negative characters from our history,
such as dictators or criminals. For example, this is what ChatGPT
produced when impersonating a bad person:
X is just another third-world country with nothing
Check the source of the experiment for more examples of different
personas: https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/researchers-
discover-a-way-to-make-chatgpt-consistently-toxic/.

## Page 728

The discussion can be extended to a never-ending list of examples,
but the key takeaway is that your LLM can produce harmful output or
receive dangerous input, so you should monitor and prepare for
them. Thus, to create safe LLM systems, you must protect them
against harmful, sensitive, or invalid input and output by adding
guardrails:
Input guardrails: Input guardrails primarily protect against three
main risks: exposing private information to external APIs,
executing harmful prompts that could compromise your system
(model jailbreaking), and accepting violent or unethical prompts.
When it comes to leaking private information to external APIs, the
risk is specific to sending sensitive data outside your organization,
such as credentials or classified information. When talking about
model jailbreaking, we mainly refer to prompt injection, such as
executing malicious SQL code that can access, delete, or corrupt
your data. Lastly, some applications don’t want to accept violent or
unethical queries from users, such as asking an LLM how to build
a bomb.
Output guardrails: At the output of an LLM response, you want
to catch failed outputs that don’t respect your application’s
standards. This can vary from one application to another, but
some examples are empty responses (these responses don’t
follow your expected format, such as JSON or YAML), toxic
responses, hallucinations, and, in general, wrong responses. Also,

## Page 729

you have to check for sensitive information that can leak from the
internal knowledge of the LLM or your RAG system.
Popular guardrail tools are Galileo Protect, which detects prompt
injections, toxic language, data privacy protection leaks, and
hallucinations. Also, you can use OpenAI’s Moderation API to detect
harmful inputs or outputs and take action on them.
The downside of adding input and output guardrails is the extra
latency added to your system, which might interfere with your
application’s user experience. Thus, there is a trade-off between the
safety of your input/output and latency. Regarding invalid outputs, as
LLMs are non-deterministic, you can implement a retry mechanism
to generate another potential candidate. However, as stated above,
running the retry sequentially will double the response time. Thus, a
common strategy is to run multiple generations in parallel and pick
the best one. This will increase redundancy but help keep the
latency in check.
Prompt monitoring
Monitoring is not new to LLMOps, but in the LLM world, we have a
new entity to manage: the prompt. Thus, we have to find specific
ways to log and analyze them.

## Page 730

Most ML platforms, such as Opik (from Comet ML) and W&B, or
other specialized tools like Langfuse, have implemented logging
tools to debug and monitor prompts. While in production, using these
tools, you usually want to track the user input, the prompt templates,
the input variables, the generated response, the number of tokens,
and the latency.
When generating an answer with an LLM, we don’t wait for the whole
answer to be generated; we stream the output token by token. This
makes the entire process snappier and more responsive. Thus,
when it comes to tracking the latency of generating an answer, the
final user experience must look at this from multiple perspectives,
such as:
Time to First Token (TTFT): The time it takes for the first token to
be generated
Time between Tokens (TBT): The interval between each token
generation
Tokens per Second (TPS): The rate at which tokens are
generated
Time per Output Token (TPOT): The time it takes to generate
each output token
Total Latency: The total time required to complete a response

## Page 731

Also, tracking the total input and output tokens is critical to
understanding the costs of hosting your LLMs.
Ultimately, you can compute metrics that validate your model’s
performance for each input, prompt, and output tuple. Depending on
your use case, you can compute things such as accuracy, toxicity,
and hallucination rate. When working with RAG systems, you can
also compute metrics relative to the relevance and precision of the
retrieved context.
Another essential thing to consider when monitoring prompts is to
log their full traces. You might have multiple intermediate steps from
the user query to the final general answer. For example, rewriting the
query to improve the RAG’s retrieval accuracy evolves one or more
intermediate steps. Thus, logging the full trace reveals the entire
process from when a user sends a query to when the final response
is returned, including the actions the system takes, the documents
retrieved, and the final prompt sent to the model. Additionally, you
can log the latency, tokens, and costs at each step, providing a more
fine-grained view of all the steps.

## Page 732

Figure 11.4: Example trace in the Langfuse UI
As shown in Figure 11.4, the end goal is to trace each step from the
user’s input until the generated answer. If something fails or behaves
unexpectedly, you can point exactly to the faulty step. The query can
fail due to an incorrect answer, an invalid context, or incorrect data
processing. Also, the application can behave unexpectedly if the

## Page 733

number of generated tokens suddenly fluctuates during specific
steps.
To conclude, LLMOps is a rapidly developing field. Given its quick
evolution, making predictions is challenging. The truth is that we are
not sure if the term LLMOps is here to stay. However, what is certain
is that numerous new use cases for LLMs will emerge, along with
tools and best practices to manage their lifecycle.
Even if this DevOps, MLOps, and LLMOps section is far from
comprehensive, it provides a strong idea of how to apply best ops
practices in our LLM Twin use case.
Deploying the LLM Twin’s pipelines
to the cloud
This section will show you how to deploy all the LLM Twin’s pipelines
to the cloud. We must deploy the entire infrastructure to have the
whole system working in the cloud. Thus, we will have to:
1. Set up an instance of MongoDB serverless.
2. Set up an instance of Qdrant serverless.
3. Deploy the ZenML pipelines, container, and artifact registry to
AWS.

## Page 734

4. Containerize the code and push the Docker image to a container
registry.
Note that the training and inference pipelines already work with AWS
SageMaker. Thus, by following the preceding four steps, we ensure
that our whole system is on the cloud, ready to scale and serve our
imaginary clients.
What are the deployment costs?
We will stick to the free versions of the MongoDB,
Qdrant, and ZenML services. As for AWS, we will
mostly stick to their free tier for running the ZenML
pipelines. The SageMaker training and inference
components are more costly to run (which we won’t run
in this section). Thus, what we will show you in the
following sections will generate minimum costs (a few
dollars at most) from AWS.
Understanding the infrastructure
Before diving into the step-by-step tutorial, where we will show you
how to set up all the necessary components, let’s briefly overview
our infrastructure and how all the elements interact. This will help us
in mindfully following the tutorials below.

## Page 735

As shown in Figure 11.5, we have a few services to set up. To keep
things simple, for MongoDB and Qdrant, we will leverage their
serverless freemium version. As for ZenML, we will leverage the free
trial of the ZenML cloud, which will help us orchestrate all the
pipelines in the cloud. How will it do that?
By leveraging the ZenML cloud, we can quickly allocate all the
required AWS resources to run, scale, and store the ML pipeline. It
will help us spin up, with a few clicks, the following AWS
components:
An ECR service for storing Docker images
An S3 object storage for storing all our artifacts and models
SageMaker Orchestrator for orchestrating, running, and scaling all
our ML pipelines

## Page 736

Figure 11.5: Infrastructure flow
Now that we understand what the essential resources of our
infrastructure are, let’s look over the core flow of running a pipeline in
the cloud that we will learn to implement, presented in Figure 11.5:

## Page 737

1. Build a Docker image that contains all the system dependencies,
the project dependencies, and the LLM Twin application.
2. Push the Docker image to ECR, where SageMaker can access it.
3. Now, we can trigger any pipeline implemented during this book
either from the CLI of our local machine or ZenML’s dashboard.
4. Each step from ZenML’s pipeline will be mapped to a SageMaker
job that runs on an AWS EC2 virtual machine (VM). Based on
the dependencies between the directed acyclic graph (DAG)
steps, some will run in parallel and others sequentially.
5. When running a step, SageMaker pulls the Docker image from
ECR, defined in step 2. Based on the pulled image, it creates a
Docker container that executes the pipeline step.
6. As the job is executed, it can access the S3 artifact storage,
MongoDB, and Qdrant vector DB to query or push data. The
ZenML dashboard is a key tool, providing real-time updates on the
pipeline’s progress and ensuring a clear view of the process.
Now that we know how the infrastructure works, let’s start by setting
up MongoDB, Qdrant, and the ZenML cloud.
What AWS cloud region should I choose?
In our tutorials, all the services will be deployed to AWS
within the Frankfurt (eu-central-1) region. You can
select another region, but be consistent across all the

## Page 738

services to ensure faster responses between
components and reduce potential errors.
How should I manage changes in the services’ UIs?
Unfortunately, MongoDB, Qdrant, or other services
may change their UI or naming conventions. As we
can’t update this book each time that happens, please
refer to their official documentation to check anything
that differs from our tutorial. We apologize for this
inconvenience, but unfortunately, it is not in our control.
Setting up MongoDB
We will show you how to create and integrate a free MongoDB
cluster into our projects. To do so, these are the steps you have to
follow:
1. Go to their site at https://www.mongodb.com and create an
account.
2. In the left panel, go to Deployment | Database and click Build a
Cluster.
3. Within the creation form, do the following:
1. Choose an M0 Free cluster.
2. Call your cluster twin.

## Page 739

3. Choose AWS as your provider.
4. Choose Frankfurt (eu-central-1) as your region. You can
choose another region, but be careful to choose the same
region for all future AWS services.
5. Leave the rest of the attributes with their default values.
6. In the bottom right, click the Create Deployment green button.
4. To test that your newly created MongoDB cluster works fine, we
must connect to it from our local machine. We used the MongoDB
VS Code extension to do so, but you can use any other tool.
Thus, from their Choose a connection method setup flow,
choose MongoDB for VS Code. Then, follow the steps provided
on their site.
5. To connect, you must paste the DB connection URL in the VS
Code extension (or another tool of your liking), which contains
your username, password, and cluster URL, similar to this one:
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>
@twin.vhxy1.mongodb.net . Make sure to save this URL
somewhere you can copy it from later.
6. If you don’t know or want to change your password, go to
Security → Quickstart in the left panel. There, you can edit your
login credentials. Be sure to save them somewhere safe, as you
won’t be able to access them later.
7. After verifying that your connections work, go to Security →
Network Access in the left panel and click ADD IP ADDRESS.

## Page 740

Then click ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE and hit
Confirm. Out of simplicity, we allow any machine from any IP to
access our MongoDB cluster. This ensures that our pipelines can
query or write to the DB without any additional complex
networking setup. It’s not the safest option for production, but for
our example, it’s perfectly fine.
8. The final step is to return to your project and open your .env file.
Now, either add or replace the DATABASE_HOST variable with your
MongoDB connection string. It should look something like this:
DATABASE_HOST= mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>
@twin.vhxy1.mongodb.net .
That’s it! Now, instead of reading and writing from your local
MongoDB, you will do it from the cloud MongoDB cluster we just
created. Let’s repeat a similar process with Qdrant.
Setting up Qdrant
We have to repeat a similar process to what we did for MongoDB.
Thus, to create a Qdrant cluster and hook it to our project, follow
these steps:
1. Go to Qdrant at https://cloud.qdrant.io/ and create an
account.
2. In the left panel, go to Clusters and click Create.

## Page 741

3. Fill out the cluster creation form with the following:
1. Choose the Free version of the cluster.
2. Choose GCP as the cloud provider (while writing the book, it
was the only one allowed for a free cluster).
3. Choose Frankfurt as the region (or the same region as you
chose for MongoDB).
4. Name the cluster twin.
5. Leave the rest of the attributes with their default values and
click Create.
4. Access the cluster in the Data Access Control section in the left
panel.
5. Click Create and choose your twin cluster to create a new access
token. Copy the newly created token somewhere safe, as you
won’t be able to access it anymore.
6. You can run their example from Usage Examples to test that your
connection works fine.
7. Go back to the Clusters section of Qdrant and open your newly
created twin cluster. You will have access to the cluster’s
endpoint, which you need to configure Qdrant in your code.
You can visualize your Qdrant collections and documents by clicking
Open Dashboard and entering your API Key as your password.
The Qdrant cluster dashboard will now be empty, but after running
the pipelines, you will see all the collections, as shown here:

## Page 742

Figure 11.6: Qdrant cluster dashboard example after being
populated with two collections.
Finally, return to your project and open your .env file. Now, we
must fill in a couple of environment variables as follows:
USE_QDRANT_CLOUD=true
QDRANT_CLOUD_URL=<the endpoint URL found at step 7
QDRANT_APIKEY=<the access token created at step 5>
That’s it! Instead of reading and writing from your local Qdrant vector
DB, you will do it from the cloud Qdrant cluster we just created. Just
to be sure that everything works fine, run the end-to-end data
pipeline with the cloud version of MongoDB and Qdrant as follows:
peotry poe run-end-to-end-data-pipeline

## Page 743

The last step is setting up the ZenML cloud and deploying all our
infrastructure to AWS.
Setting up the ZenML cloud
Setting up the ZenML cloud and the AWS infrastructure is a multi-
step process. First, we will set up a ZenML cloud account, then the
AWS infrastructure through the ZenML cloud, and, finally, we will
bundle our code in a Docker image to run it in AWS SageMaker.
Let’s start with setting up the ZenML cloud:
1. Go to the ZenML cloud at https://cloud.zenml.io and make
an account. They provide a seven-day free trial, which is enough
to run our examples.
2. Fill out their onboarding form and create an organization with a
unique name and a tenant called twin. A tenant refers to a
deployment of ZenML in a fully isolated environment. Wait a few
minutes until your tenant server is up before proceeding to the
next step.
3. If you want to, you can go through their Quickstart Guide to
understand how the ZenML cloud works with a simpler example. It
is not required to go through it to deploy the LLM Twin application,
but we recommend it to ensure everything works fine.

## Page 744

4. At this point, we assume that you have gone through the
Quickstart Guide. Otherwise, you might encounter issues during
the next steps. To connect our project with this ZenML cloud
tenant, return to the project and run the zenml connect
command provided in the dashboard. It looks similar to the
following example but with a different URL: zenml connect --
url https://0c37a553-zenml.cloudinfra.zenml.io .
5. To ensure everything works fine, run a random pipeline from your
code. Note that at this point, we are still running it locally, but
instead of logging the results to the local server, we log everything
to the cloud version:
poetry poe run-digital-data-etl
6. Go to the Pipelines section in the left panel of the ZenML
dashboard. If everything worked fine, you should see the pipeline
you ran in Step 5 there.
Ensure that your ZenML server version matches
your local ZenML version. For example, when we
wrote this book, both were version 0.64.0. If they
don’t match, you might encounter strange behavior,
or it might not work correctly. The easiest fix is to go
to your pyproject.toml file, find the zenml
dependency, and update it with the version of your

## Page 745

server. Then run poetry lock --no-update &&
poetry install to update your local virtual
environment.
To ship the code to AWS, you must create a ZenML stack. A stack is
a set of components, such as the underlying orchestrator, object
storage, and container registry, that ZenML needs under the hood to
run the pipelines. Intuitively, you can see your stack as your
infrastructure. While working locally, ZenML offers a default stack
that allows you to quickly develop your code and test things locally.
However, by defining different stacks, you can quickly switch
between different infrastructure environments, such as local and
AWS runs, which we will showcase in this section.
Before starting this section, ensure you have an AWS
account with admin permissions ready.
With that in mind, let’s create an AWS stack for our project. To do so,
follow the next steps:
1. In the left panel, click on the Stacks section and hit the New
Stack button.
2. You will have multiple options for creating a stack, but the easiest
is creating one from scratch within the in-browser experience,

## Page 746

which doesn’t require additional preparations. This is not very
flexible, but it is enough to host our project. Thus, choose Create
New Infrastructure → In-browser Experience.
3. Then, choose AWS as your cloud provider.
4. Choose Europe (Frankfurt)—eu-central-1 as your location or the
region you used to set up MongoDB and Qdrant.
5. Name it aws-stack. It is essential to name it exactly like this so
that the commands that we will use work.
6. Now ZenML will create a set of IAM roles to give permissions to
all the other components to communicate with each other, an S3
bucket as your artifact storage, an ECR repository as your
container registry, and SageMaker as your orchestrator.
7. Click Next.
8. Click the Deploy to AWS button. It will open a CloudFormation
page on AWS. ZenML leverages CloudFormation (an
infrastructure as code, or IaC, tool) to create all the AWS
resources we enumerated in Step 6.
9. At the bottom, check all the boxes to acknowledge that AWS
CloudFormation will create AWS resources on your behalf. Finally,
click the Create stack button. Now, we must wait for a couple of
minutes for AWS CloudFormation to spin up all the resources.
10. Return to the ZenML page and click the Finish button.
By leveraging ZenML, we efficiently deployed the entire AWS
infrastructure for our ML pipelines. We began with a basic example,

## Page 747

sacrificing some control. However, if you seek more control, ZenML
offers the option to use Terraform (an IaC tool) to fully control your
AWS resources or to connect ZenML with your current infrastructure.
Before moving to the next step, let’s have a quick recap of the AWS
resources we just created:
An IAM role is an AWS identity with permissions policies that
define what actions are allowed or denied for that role. It is used
to grant access to AWS services without needing to share security
credentials.
S3 is a scalable and secure object storage service that allows
storing and retrieving files from anywhere on the web. It is
commonly used for data backup, content storage, and data lakes.
It’s more scalable and flexible than Google Drive.
ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes
storing, managing, and deploying Docker container images easy.
SageMaker is a fully managed service that allows developers and
data scientists to quickly build, train, and deploy ML models.
SageMaker Orchestrator is a feature of SageMaker that helps
automate the execution of ML workflows, manage dependencies
between steps, and ensure the reproducibility and scalability of
model training and deployment pipelines. Other similar tools are
Prefect, Dagster, Metaflow, and Airflow.

## Page 748

CloudFormation is a service that allows you to model and set up
your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing
them and more time focusing on your applications. It automates
the process of provisioning AWS infrastructure using templates.
Before running the ML pipelines, the last step is to containerize the
code and prepare a Docker image that packages our dependencies
and code.
Containerize the code using Docker
So far, we have defined our infrastructure, MongoDB, Qdrant, and
AWS, for storage and computing. The last step is to find a way to
take our code and run it on top of this infrastructure. The most
popular solution is Docker, a tool that allows us to create an isolated
environment (a container) that contains everything we need to run
our application, such as system dependencies, Python
dependencies, and the code.
We defined our Docker image at the project’s root in the
Dockerfile . This is the standard naming convention for Docker.
Before digging into the code, if you want to build the Docker image
yourself, ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. If
you don’t have it, you can install it by following the instructions
provided here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install. Now,
let’s look at the content of the Dockerfile step by step.

## Page 749

The Dockerfile begins by specifying the base image, which is a
lightweight version of Python 3.11 based on the Debian Bullseye
distribution. The environment variables are then set up to configure
various aspects of the container, such as the workspace directory,
turning off Python bytecode generation, and configuring Python to
output directly to the terminal. Additionally, the version of Poetry to
be installed is specified, and a few environment variables are set to
ensure that package installations are non-interactive, which is vital
for automated builds.
FROM python:3.11-slim-bullseye AS release
ENV WORKSPACE_ROOT=/app/
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV POETRY_VERSION=1.8.3
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ENV POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1
Next, we install Google Chrome in the container. The installation
process begins by updating the package lists and installing essential
tools like gnupg, wget, and curl. The Google Linux signing key is
added, and the Google Chrome repository is configured. After
another package list update, the stable version of Google Chrome is
installed. The package lists are removed after installation to keep the
image as small as possible.

## Page 750

RUN apt-get update -y && \
apt-get install -y gnupg wget curl --no-instal
wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/l
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/googl
apt-get update -y && \
apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable && \
rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
Following the Chrome installation, other essential system
dependencies are installed. Once these packages are installed, the
package cache is cleaned up to reduce the image size further.
RUN apt-get update -y \
&& apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends
gcc \
python3-dev \
build-essential \
libglib2.0-dev \
libnss3-dev \
&& apt-get clean \
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
Poetry, the dependency management tool, is then installed using pip.
The --no-cache-dir option prevents pip from caching packages,
helping to keep the image smaller. After installation, Poetry is

## Page 751

configured to use up to 20 parallel workers when installing packages,
which can speed up the installation process.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir "poetry==$POETRY_VE
RUN poetry config installer.max-workers 20
The working directory inside the container is set to
WORKSPACE_ROOT , which defaults to /app/ , where the application
code will reside. The pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files
define the Python’s project dependencies and are copied into this
directory.
WORKDIR $WORKSPACE_ROOT
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock $WORKSPACE_ROOT
With the dependency files in place, the project’s dependencies are
installed using Poetry. The configuration turns off the creation of a
virtual environment, meaning the dependencies will be installed
directly into the container’s Python environment. The installation
excludes development dependencies and prevents caching to
minimize space usage.
Additionally, the poethepoet plugin is installed to help manage
tasks within the project. Finally, any remaining Poetry cache is

## Page 752

removed to keep the container as lean as possible.
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false && \
poetry install --no-root --no-interaction --no
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugin]' &&
rm -rf ~/.cache/pypoetry/cache/ && \
rm -rf ~/.cache/pypoetry/artifacts/
In the final step, the entire project directory from the host machine is
copied into the container’s working directory. This step ensures that
all the application files are available within the container.
One important trick when writing a Dockerfile is to decouple your
installation steps from copying the rest of the files. This is useful
because each Docker command is cached and layered on top of
each other. Thus, whenever you change one layer when rebuilding
the Docker image, all the layers below the one altered are executed
again. Because you rarely change your system and project
dependencies but mostly change your code, copying your project
files in the last step makes rebuilding Docker images fast by taking
advantage of the caching mechanism’s full potential.
COPY . $WORKSPACE_ROOT

## Page 753

This Dockerfile is designed to create a clean, consistent Python
environment with all necessary dependencies. It allows the project to
run smoothly in any environment that supports Docker.
The last step is to build the Docker image and push it to the ECR
created by ZenML. To build the Docker image from the root of the
project, run the following:
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t llmt
We must build it on a Linux platform as the Google Chrome installer
we used inside Docker works only on a Linux machine. Even if you
use a macOS or Windows machine, Docker can emulate a virtual
Linux container.
The tag of the newly created Docker image is llmtwin . We also
provide this build command under a poethepoet command:
poetry poe build-docker-image
Now, let’s push the Docker image to ECR. To do so, navigate to your
AWS console and then to the ECR service. From there, find the
newly created ECR repository. It should be prefixed with zenml-* ,
as shown here:

## Page 754

Figure 11.7: AWS ECR example
The first step is to authenticate to ECR. For this to work, ensure that
you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your admin
AWS credentials, as explained in Chapter 2:
AWS_REGION=<your_region> # e.g. AWS_REGION=eu-cent
AWS_ECR_URL=<your_acount_id>
aws ecr get-login-password --region ${AWS_REGION}|
You can get your current AWS_REGION by clicking on the toggle in
the top-right corner, as seen in Figure 11.8. Also, you can copy the
ECR URL to fill the AWS_ECR_URL variable from the main AWS ECR
dashboard, as illustrated in Figure 11.7. After running the previous
command, you should see the message Login Succeeded on the
CLI.

## Page 755

Figure 11.8: AWS region and account details
Now we have to add another tag to the llmtwin Docker image that
signals the Docker registry we want to push it to:
docker tag llmtwin ${AWS_ECR_URL}:latest
Finally, we push it to ECR by running:
docker push ${AWS_ECR_URL}:latest
After the upload is finished, return to your AWS ECR dashboard and
open your ZenML repository. The Docker image should appear, as
shown here:

## Page 756

Figure 11.9: AWS ECR repository example after the Docker image is
pushed
For every change in the code that you need to ship and test, you
would have to go through all these steps, which are tedious and
error-prone. The Adding LLMOps to the LLM Twin section of this
chapter will teach us how to automate these steps within the CD
pipeline using GitHub Actions. Still, we first wanted to go through
them manually to fully understand the behind-the-scenes process
and not treat it as a black box. Understanding these details is vital for
debugging your CI/CD pipelines, where you must understand the
error messages and how to fix them.
Now that we have built our Docker image and pushed it to AWS
ECR, let’s deploy it to AWS.
Run the pipelines on AWS

## Page 757

We are very close to running the ML pipelines on AWS, but we have
to go through a few final steps. Let’s switch from the default ZenML
stack to the AWS one we created in this chapter. From the root of
your project, run the following in the CLI:
zenml stack set aws-stack
Return to your AWS ECR ZenML repository and copy the image URI
as shown in Figure 11.9. Then, go to the configs directory, open
the configs/end_to_end_data.yaml file, and update the
settings.docker.parent_image attribute with your ECR URL, as
shown below:
settings:
docker:
parent_image: <YOUR ECR URL> #e.g., 9923827978
skip_build: True
We’ve configured the pipeline to always use the latest Docker image
available in ECR. This means that the pipeline will automatically pick
up the latest changes made to the code whenever we push a new
image.

## Page 758

We must export all the credentials from our .env file to ZenML
secrets, a feature that safely stores your credentials and makes
them accessible within your pipelines:
poetry poe export-settings-to-zenml
The last step is setting up to run the pipelines asynchronously so we
don’t have to wait until they are finished, which might result in
timeout errors:
zenml orchestrator update aws-stack --synchronous=
Now that ZenML knows to use the AWS stack, our custom Docker
image, and has access to our credentials, we are finally done with
the setup. Run the end-to-end-data-pipeline with the following
command:
poetry poe run-end-to-end-data-pipeline
Now you can go to ZenML Cloud → Pipelines →
end_to_end_data and open the latest run. On the ZenML
dashboard, you can visualize the latest state of the pipeline, as seen

## Page 759

in Figure 11.10. Note that this pipeline runs all the data-related
pipelines in a single run.
In the Adding LLMOps to the LLM Twin section, we will explain why
we compressed all the steps into a single pipeline.
Figure 11.10: ZenML example of running the end-to-end-data-
pipeline
You can click on any running block and find details about the run, the
code used for that specific step, and the logs for monitoring and
debugging, as illustrated in Figure 11.11:

## Page 760

Figure 11.11: ZenML step metadata example
To run other pipelines, you have to update the
settings.docker.parent_image attribute in their
config file under the configs/ directory.
To find even more details about the runs, you can go to AWS
SageMaker. In the left panel, click SageMaker dashboard, and on
the right, in the Processing column, click on the green Running
section, as shown in Figure 11.12.

## Page 761

This will open a list of all the processing jobs that execute your
ZenML pipelines.
Figure 11.12: SageMaker dashboard
If you want to run the pipelines locally again, use the
following CLI command:
poetry poe set-local-stack
If you want to disconnect from the ZenML cloud
dashboard and use the local version again, run the
following:
zenml disconnect

## Page 762

Troubleshooting the
ResourceLimitExceeded error after
running a ZenML pipeline on
SageMaker
Let’s assume, you’ve encountered a ResourceLimitExceeded error
after running a ZenML pipeline on SageMaker using the AWS stack.
In this case, you have to explicitly ask AWS to give you access to a
specific type of AWS EC2 VM.
ZenML uses, by default, ml.t3.medium EC2 machines, which are
part of the AWS freemium tier. However, some AWS accounts cannot
access these VMs by default. To check your access, search your
AWS console for Service Quotas.
Then, in the left panel, click on AWS services, search for Amazon
SageMaker, and then for ml.t3.medium . In Figure 11.13, you can
see our quotas for these types of machines. If yours is 0, you should
request that AWS increase them to numbers similar to those from
Figure 11.13 in the Applied account-level quota value column. The
whole process is free of charge and only requires a few clicks.
Unfortunately, you might have to wait for a few hours up to one day
until AWS accepts your request.

## Page 763

Figure 11.13: SageMaker—ml.t3.medium expected quotas
You can find step-by-step instructions on how to solve this error and
request new quotas at this link: https://repost.aws/knowledge-
center/sagemaker-resource-limit-exceeded-error.
If you changed the values from your .env file and want
to update the ZenML secrets with them, first run the
following CLI command to delete the old secrets:
poetry poe delete-settings-zenml
Then, you can export them again by running:
poetry poe export-settings-to-zenml

## Page 764

Adding LLMOps to the LLM Twin
In the previous section, we saw how to set up the infrastructure for
the LLM Twin project by manually building the Docker image and
pushing it to ECR. We want to automate the entire process and
implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and a CT pipeline
using ZenML. As mentioned earlier, implementing a CI/CD/CT
pipeline ensures that each feature pushed to main branches is
consistent and tested. Also, by automating the deployment and
training, you support collaboration, save time, and reduce human
errors.
Finally, at the end of the section, we will show you how to implement
a prompt monitoring pipeline using Opik from Comet ML and an
alerting system using ZenML. This prompt monitoring pipeline will
help us debug and analyze the RAG and LLM logic. As LLM systems
are non-deterministic, capturing and storing the prompt traces is
essential for monitoring your ML logic.
Before diving into the implementation, let’s start with a quick section
on the LLM Twin’s CI/CD pipeline flow.
LLM Twin’s CI/CD pipeline flow

## Page 765

We have two environments: staging and production. When
developing a new feature, we create a new branch out of the staging
branch and develop solely on that one. When we are done and
consider the feature finished, we open a pull request (PR) to the
staging branch. After the feature branch is accepted, it is merged into
the staging branch. This is a standard workflow in most software
applications. There might be variations, like adding a dev
environment, but the principles remain the same.
As illustrated in Figure 11.14, the CI pipeline is triggered when the
PR opens. At this point, we test the feature branch for linting and
formatting errors. Also, we run a gitleaks command to check for
credentials and sensitive information that was committed by mistake.
If the linting, formatting, and gitleaks steps pass (also known as
static analysis), we run the automated tests. Note that the static
analysis steps run faster than the automated tests. Thus, the order
matters. That’s why adding the static analysis steps at the beginning
of the CI pipeline is good practice. We propose the following order of
the CI steps:
gitleaks checks
Linting checks
Formatting checks
Automated testing, such as unit and integration tests

## Page 766

If any check fails, the CI pipeline fails, and the developer who
created the PR cannot merge it into the staging branch until it fixes
the issues.
Implementing a CI pipeline ensures that new features follow the
repository’s standards and don’t break existing functionality. The
exact process repeats when we plan to merge the staging branch
into the production one. We open a PR, and the CI pipeline is
automatically executed before merging the staging branch into
production.

## Page 767

Figure 11.14: CI/CD pipelines flow
The CD pipeline runs after the branch is merged. For example, after
the feature branch is merged into staging, the CD pipeline takes the
code from the staging branch, builds a new Docker image, and
pushes it to the AWS ECR Docker repository. When running future

## Page 768

pipeline runs in the staging environment, it will use the latest Docker
image that was built by the CD pipeline. The exact process happens
between staging and production. Still, the key difference is that the
staging environment exists as an experimental place where the QA
team and stakeholders can further manually test the new feature
along with what is automatically tested in the CI pipeline.
In our repository, we used only a main branch, which
reflects production, and feature branches to push new
work. We did this to keep things simple, but the same
principles apply. To extend the flow, you must create a
staging branch and add it to the CD pipeline.
More on formatting errors
Formatting errors relate to the style and structure of your code,
ensuring that it adheres to a consistent visual layout. This can
include the placement of spaces, indentation, line length, and other
stylistic elements.
The main purpose of formatting is to make your code more readable
and maintainable. Consistent formatting helps teams work together
more effectively, as the code looks uniform, regardless of who wrote
it. Examples of formatting errors are:

## Page 769

Incorrect indentation (e.g., mixing spaces and tabs)
Lines that are too long (e.g., exceeding 79 or 88 characters,
depending on your style guide)
Missing or extra spaces around operators or after commas
More on linting errors
Linting errors relate to potential issues in your code that could lead to
bugs, inefficiencies, or non-adherence to coding standards beyond
just style. Linting checks often involve static analysis of the code to
catch things like unused variables, undefined names, or
questionable practices.
Linting’s main goal is to catch potential errors or bad practices early
in the development process, improving code quality and reducing the
likelihood of bugs. Examples of linting errors are:
Unused imports or variables
Undefined variables or functions are being used
Potentially dangerous code (e.g., using == instead of is for
checking against None )
We use Ruff, a versatile tool for formatting and linting. It incorporates
checks for common formatting issues and PEP 8 compliance, as well
as deeper linting checks for potential errors and code quality
problems. Also, it is written in Rust, making it fast for big codebases.

## Page 770

Before implementing what we’ve explained above, let’s examine the
core principles of GitHub Actions.
Quick overview of GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform provided by GitHub that allows
developers to automate their workflows directly within a GitHub
repository. It enables users to build, test, and deploy their code
directly from GitHub by defining workflows in YAML files. Since it’s
part of GitHub, it works seamlessly with repositories, issues, PRs,
and other GitHub features. Here are the key components you should
know about:
Workflows: A workflow is an automated process defined in a
YAML file located in your repository’s .github/workflows
directory . It specifies what should happen (e.g., build , test ,
and deploy ) and when (e.g., on push, on PR).
Jobs: Workflows are made up of jobs, which are groups of steps
that execute on the same runner. Each job runs in its own virtual
environment.
Steps: Jobs are made up of multiple independent steps, which
can be actions or shell commands.
Actions: Actions are reusable commands or scripts. You can use
pre-built actions from GitHub Marketplace or create your own. You
can think of them as Python functions.

## Page 771

Runners: Runners are the servers that run your jobs. GitHub
provides hosted runners (Linux, Windows, macOS), or you can
even self-host your runners.
A workflow is described using YAML syntax. For example, a simple
workflow that clones the current GitHub repository and installs
Python 3.11 on an Ubuntu machine looks like this:
name: Example
on: [push]
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Checkout
uses: actions/checkout@v3
- name: Setup Python
uses: actions/setup-python@v3
with:
python-version: "3.11"
The workflows are triggered by events like push , pull_request ,
or schedule . For example, you might trigger a workflow every time
code is pushed to a specific branch. Now that we understand how
GitHub Actions works, let’s look at the LLM Twin’s CI pipeline.

## Page 772

The CI pipeline
The LLM Twin’s CI pipeline is split into two jobs:
A QA job that looks for formatting and linting errors using Ruff.
Also, it runs a gitleaks step to scan for leaked secrets
throughout our repository.
A test job that runs all our automatic tests using Pytest . In our
use case, we implemented just a dummy test to showcase the CI
pipeline, but using the structure from this book, you can easily
extend it with real tests for your use case.
GitHub Actions CI YAML file
The YAML file sits under .github/workflows/ci.yaml . It begins
by defining the workflow’s name as CI , as you can see in the
following snippet. This label will be used to identify the workflow
within GitHub’s Actions interface. Next, the section specifies that the
workflow should be triggered whenever a pull_request event
occurs. Hence, the CI workflow will automatically run whenever a PR
is opened, synchronized, or reopened.
name: CI
on:
pull_request:

## Page 773

The concurrency section ensures that only one instance of this
workflow runs for a given reference (like a branch) at any given time.
The group field is defined using GitHub’s expression syntax to
create a unique group name based on the workflow and the
reference. The cancel-in-progress: true line ensures that if a
new workflow run is triggered before the previous one finishes, the
previous run is canceled. This is particularly useful to prevent
redundant executions of the same workflow.
concurrency:
group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
cancel-in-progress: true
The workflow defines two separate jobs: qa and test . Each job
runs on the latest version of Ubuntu, specified by runs-on:
ubuntu-latest .
The first job, named QA , is responsible for quality assurance tasks
like code checks and formatting verification. Within the qa job, the
first step is to check out the repository’s code using the
actions/checkout@v3 action. This step is necessary to ensure
that the job has access to the code that needs to be analyzed.
jobs:
qa:

## Page 774

name: QA
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Checkout
uses: actions/checkout@v3
The next step is to set up the Python environment. This is done
using the actions/setup-python@v3 action, with the Python
version specified as "3.11" . This step ensures that the subsequent
steps in the job will run in the correct Python environment.
- name: Setup Python
uses: actions/setup-python@v3
with:
python-version: "3.11"
The workflow then installs Poetry using the abatilo/actions-
poetry@v2 action, specifying the version of Poetry as 1.8.3 :
- name: Install poetry
uses: abatilo/actions-poetry@v2
with:
poetry-version: 1.8.3

## Page 775

Once Poetry is set up, the workflow installs the project’s
development dependencies using the poetry install --only
dev command. Additionally, the workflow adds the poethepoet
plugin for Poetry, which will be used to run predefined tasks more
conveniently within the project.
- name: Install packages
run: |
poetry install --only dev
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugi
The qa job then runs several quality checks on the code. The first
check uses a tool called gitleaks to scan for secrets in the
codebase, ensuring that no sensitive information is accidentally
committed:
- name: gitleaks check
run: poetry poe gitleaks-check
Following the gitleaks check, the workflow runs a linting process
to enforce coding standards and best practices in the Python code.
This is achieved through the poetry poe lint-check command,
which uses Ruff under the hood.

## Page 776

- name: Lint check [Python]
run: poetry poe lint-check
The last step in the qa job is a format check, which ensures that the
Python code is properly formatted according to the project’s style
guidelines. This is done using the poetry poe format-check
command, which uses Ruff under the hood.
- name: Format check [Python]
run: poetry poe format-check
The second job defined in the workflow is the test job, which also
runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. Like the qa job, it starts by
checking out the code from the repository and installing Python 3.11
and Poetry 1.8.3.
test:
name: Test
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Checkout
uses: actions/checkout@v3
…

## Page 777

After setting up the system dependencies, the test job installs all
the project’s dependencies with the poetry install command. As
we want to run the tests, this time, we need to install all the
dependencies that are required to run the application.
- name: Install packages
run: |
poetry install –-without aws
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugi
Finally, the test job runs the project’s tests using the poetry poe
test command. This step ensures that all tests are executed and
provides feedback on whether the current code changes break any
functionality.
- name: Run tests
run: |
echo "Running tests..."
poetry poe test
If any of the steps from the QA or test jobs fail, the GitHub Actions
workflow will fail, resulting in the PR not being able to be merged
until the issue is fixed. By taking this approach, we ensure that all the
new features added to the main branches respect the standard of

## Page 778

the project and that it doesn’t break existing functionality through
automated tests.
Figure 11.15 shows the CI pipeline in the Actions tab of the GitHub
repository. It was run after a commit with the message feat: Add
Docker image and CD pipeline and ran the two jobs described
above, QA and Test.
Figure 11.15: GitHub Actions CI pipeline run example
The CD pipeline
The CD pipeline will automate the Docker steps we manually
performed in the Deploying the LLM Twin’s pipelines to the cloud

## Page 779

section, which are:
Set up Docker.
Log in to AWS.
Build the Docker image.
Push the Docker image to AWS ECR.
With that in mind, let’s look at the GitHub Actions YAML file, which
sits under .github/workflows/cd.yaml . It begins by naming the
workflow CD and specifying the trigger for this workflow. The trigger
is any push to the repository’s main branch. This workflow will
automatically run when new code is pushed to the main branch,
usually when a PR is merged into the main branch. The on.push
configuration sets up the trigger:
name: CD
on:
push:
branches:
- main
The workflow then defines a single job named Build & Push
Docker Image :

## Page 780

jobs:
build:
name: Build & Push Docker Image
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
The first step within the job is to check out the repository’s code.
steps:
- name: Checkout Code
uses: actions/checkout@v3
After checking out the code, the workflow sets up docker buildx, a
Docker CLI plugin that extends Docker’s build capabilities with
features like multi-platform builds and cache import/export:
- name: Set up Docker Buildx
uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
The next step involves configuring the AWS credentials. This step is
crucial for interacting with AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic
Container Registry (ECR), where the Docker images will be
pushed. The AWS access key, secret access key, and region are
securely retrieved from the repository’s secrets to authenticate the
workflow with AWS. This ensures the workflow has the necessary

## Page 781

permissions to push Docker images to the ECR repository. We will
show you how to configure these secrets after wrapping up with the
YAML file:
- name: Configure AWS credentials
uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
with:
aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_
aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_
aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
Once the AWS credentials are configured, the workflow logs in to
Amazon ECR. This step is essential for authenticating the Docker
CLI with the ECR registry, allowing subsequent steps to push images
to the registry:
- name: Login to Amazon ECR
id: login-ecr
uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
The final step in the workflow involves building the Docker image
and pushing it to the Amazon ECR repository. This is accomplished
using the docker/build-push-action@v6 action. The context
specifies the build context, which is typically the repository’s root

## Page 782

directory. The file option points to the Dockerfile , which
defines how the image should be built. The tags section assigns
tags to the image, including the specific commit SHA and the
latest tag, which is a common practice for identifying the most
recent version of the image. The push option is set to true ,
meaning the image will be uploaded to ECR after it is built:
- name: Build images & push to ECR
id: build-image
uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
with:
context: .
file: ./Dockerfile
tags: |
${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}/${{
${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}/${{
push: true
To conclude, the CD pipeline authenticates to AWS, builds the
Docker image, and pushes it to AWS ECR. The Docker image is
pushed with latest and the commit’s SHA tag. By doing so, we
can always use the latest image and point to the commit of the code
from which the image was generated.

## Page 783

Also, in our code, we have only a main branch, which reflects our
production environment. But you, as a developer, have the power to
extend this functionality with a staging and dev environment. You just
have to add the name of the branches in the on.push.branches
configuration at the beginning of the YAML file.
In Figure 11.16, you can observe how the CD pipeline looks after a
PR is merged into the production branch. As seen before, we only
have the Build & Push Docker Image job here.
Figure 11.16: GitHub Actions CD pipeline run example
The last step in setting up the CI/CD pipeline is to test it and see how
it works.

## Page 784

Test out the CI/CD pipeline
To test the CI/CD pipelines yourself, you must fork the LLM-
Engineering repository to have full write access to the GitHub
repository. Here is the official tutorial on how to fork a GitHub project:
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-
with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo
The last step is to set up a few secrets that will allow the CD pipeline
to log in to AWS and point to the right ECR resource. To do so, go to
the Settings tab at the top of the forked repository in GitHub. In the
left panel, in the Security section, click on the Secrets and
Variables toggle and, finally, on Actions. Then, on the Secrets tab,
create four repository secrets, as shown in Figure 11.17. These
secrets will be securely stored and accessible only by the GitHub
Actions CD pipeline.
The AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are the
AWS credentials you used across the book. In Chapter 2, you see
how to create them. The AWS_REGION (e.g., eu-central-1 ) and
AWS_ECR_NAME are the same ones used in the Deploying the LLM
Twin’s pipelines to the cloud section.
For the AWS_ECR_NAME , you should configure only the
name of the repository (e.g., zenml-vrsopg ) and not

## Page 785

the full URI (e.g., 992382797823.dkr.ecr.eu-
central-1.amazonaws.com/zenml-vrsopg), as seen
in the image below:
Figure 11.17: Configuring only repository name
To trigger the CI pipeline, create a feature branch, modify the code or
documentation, and create a PR to the main branch. To trigger the
CD pipeline, merge the PR into the main branch.
After the CD GitHub Actions are complete, check the ECR repository
to see whether the Docker image was pushed successfully.

## Page 786

Figure 11.18: GitHub Actions secrets
If you need more details on how to set up GitHub Actions secrets, we
recommend checking out their official documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-
actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions
The CT pipeline
To implement the CT pipeline, we will leverage ZenML. Once ZenML
(or other orchestrators such as Metaflow, Dagster, or Airflow)
orchestrates all your pipelines and your infrastructure is deployed,
you are very close to reaching CT.

## Page 787

Remember the core difference between the CI/CD and CT pipelines.
The CI/CD pipeline takes care of testing, building, and deploying
your code—a dimension that any software program has. The CT
pipeline leverages the code managed by the CI/CD pipeline to
automate your data, training, and model-serving process, where the
data and model dimensions are present only in the AI world.
Before diving into the implementation, we want to highlight two
design choices that made reaching CT simple:
The FTI architecture: A modular system with clear interfaces and
components made it easy to capture the relationship between the
pipelines and automate them.
Starting with an orchestrator since day 0: We started with
ZenML at the beginning of the project’s development. Early on, we
only used it locally. But it acted as an entry point for our pipelines
and a way to monitor their execution. Doing so forced us to
decouple each pipeline and transfer the communication between
them solely through various types of data storage, such as the
data warehouse, feature store, or artifact store. As we have
leveraged ZenML since day 0, we got rid of implementing a
tedious CLI to configure our application. Instead, we did it directly
through YAML configuration files out of the box.

## Page 788

In Figure 11.19, we can see all the pipelines that we have to chain
together to fully automate our training and deployment. The pipelines
aren’t new; they aggregate everything we’ve covered throughout this
book. Thus, at this point, we will treat them as black boxes that
interact with each other.

## Page 789

Figure 11.19: CT pipeline
For the LLM Twin’s CT pipeline, we have to discuss the initial trigger
that starts the pipelines and how the pipelines are triggered by each
other.
Initial triggers
As illustrated in Figure 11.18, we initially want to trigger the data
collection pipeline. Usually, the triggers can be of three types:
Manual triggers: Done through the CLI or the orchestrator’s
dashboard, in our case, through the ZenML dashboard. Manual
triggers are still extremely powerful tools, as you need just one
action to start the whole ML system, from data gathering to
deployment, instead of fiddling with dozens of scripts that you
might configure wrong or run in an invalid order.
REST API triggers: You can call a pipeline by an HTTP request.
This is extremely useful when integrating your ML pipelines with
other components. For example, you can have a watcher
constantly looking for new articles. It triggers the ML logic using
this REST API trigger when it finds some. To find more details on
this feature, check out this tutorial on ZenML’s documentation:
https://docs.zenml.io/v/docs/how-to/trigger-
pipelines/trigger-a-pipeline-from-rest-api.

## Page 790

Scheduled triggers: Another common approach is to schedule
your pipeline to run constantly on a fixed interval. For example,
depending on your use case, you can schedule your pipeline to
run daily, hourly, or every minute. Most of the orchestrators,
ZenML included, provide a cron expression interface where you
can define your execution frequency. In the following example
from ZenML, the pipeline is scheduled every hour:
Schedule(cron_expression="* * 1 * *")
We chose a manual trigger for our LLM Twin use case as we don’t
have other components to leverage the REST API triggers. Also, as
the datasets are generated from a list of static links defined in the
ZenML configs, running them on a schedule doesn’t make sense as
they would always yield the same results.
But a possible next step for the project is to implement a watcher
that monitors for new articles. When it finds any, it generates a new
config and triggers the pipelines through the REST API. Another
option is implementing the watcher as an additional pipeline and
leveraging the schedule triggers to look daily for new data. If it finds
any, it executes the whole ML system; otherwise, it stops.
The conclusion is that once you can manually trigger all your ML
pipelines through a single command, you can quickly adapt it to

## Page 791

more advanced and complex scenarios.
Trigger downstream pipelines
To keep things simple, we sequentially chained all the pipelines.
More concretely, when the data collection pipeline has finished, it will
trigger the feature pipeline. When the feature pipeline has been
completed successfully, it triggers the dataset generation pipeline,
and so on. You can make the logic more complex, like scheduling
the generate instruct dataset pipeline to run daily, checking the
amount of new data in the Qdrant vector DB, and starting only if it
has enough new data. From this point, you can further tweak the
system’s parameters and optimize them to reduce costs.
To trigger all the pipelines in one go, we created one master pipeline
that aggregates everything in one entry point:
@pipeline
def end_to_end_data(
author_links: list[dict[str, str | list[str]]]
) -> None:
wait_for_ids = []
for author_data in author_links:
last_step_invocation_id = digital_data_etl
user_full_name=author_data["user_full_
)
wait for ids append(last step invocation i

## Page 792

wait_for_ids.append(last_step_invocation_i
author_full_names = [author_data["user_full_na
wait_for_ids = feature_engineering(author_full
generate_instruct_datasets(…)
training(…)
deploy(…)
To keep the function light, we added all the logic up to computing the
features. But, as we suggested in the code snippet above, you can
easily add the instruction dataset generation, training, and deploy
logic to the parent pipeline to implement an end-to-end flow. By
doing that, you can automate everything from data collection to
deploying the model.
To run the end-to-end pipeline, use the following poe command:
poetry poe run-end-to-end-data-pipeline
What we implemented is not the best approach, as it compresses all
the steps into a single monolith pipeline (which we want to avoid), as
illustrated in Figure 11.20. Usually, you want to keep each pipeline
isolated and use triggers to start downstream pipelines. This makes
the system easier to understand, debug, and monitor.

## Page 793

Figure 11.20: End-to-end pipeline illustrated in ZenML’s dashboard
Unfortunately, the ZenML cloud’s free trial has a limitation of a
maximum of three pipelines. As we have more, we avoided that
limitation by compressing all the steps into a single pipeline. But if
you plan to host ZenML yourself or buy their license, they offer the
possibility to independently trigger a pipeline from another pipeline,
as you can see in the code snippet below where we triggered the
feature engineering pipeline after the data collection ETL:

## Page 794

from zenml import pipeline, step
@pipeline
def digital_data_etl(user_full_name: str, links: l
user = get_or_create_user(user_full_name)
crawl_links(user=user, links=links)
trigger_feature_engineering_pipeline(user)
@step
def trigger_feature_engineering_pipeline(user):
run_config = PipelineRunConfiguration(…)
Client().trigger_pipeline("feature_engineering", r
@pipeline
def feature_engineering(author_full_names: list[st
… # ZenML steps
By taking this approach, each pipeline will have its independent run,
where one pipeline sequentially triggers the next one, as described
at the beginning of this section. Note that this feature is not unique to
ZenML but is common in orchestrator tools. The principles we have
learned so far hold. Only how we interact with the tool changes.
Prompt monitoring
We will use Opik (from Comet ML) to monitor our prompts. But
remember from the LLMOps section earlier in this chapter that we
are not interested only in the input prompt and generated answer.

## Page 795

We want to log the entire trace from the user’s input until the final
result is available. Before diving into the LLM Twin use case, let’s
look at a simpler example:
from opik import track
import openai
from opik.integrations.openai import track_openai
openai_client = track_openai(openai.OpenAI())
@track
def preprocess_input(text: str) -> str:
return text.strip().lower()
@track
def generate_response(prompt: str) -> str:
response = openai_client.chat.completions.crea
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prom
)
return response.choices[0].message.content
@track
def postprocess_output(response: str) -> str:
return response.capitalize()
@track(name="llm_chain")
def llm_chain(input_text: str) -> str:
preprocessed = preprocess_input(input_text)
generated = generate_response(preprocessed)
postprocessed = postprocess_output(generated)
return postprocessed

## Page 796

return postprocessed
result = llm_chain("Hello, do you enjoy reading th
The preceding code snippet reflects in a simplistic way what most
LLM applications will look like. You have the llm_chain() main
function, which takes the initial input as a parameter and returns the
final result.
Then, you have preprocessing and postprocessing functions
surrounding the actual LLM call. Using the @track() decorator, we
log the input and output of each function, which will ultimately be
aggregated into a single trace. By doing so, we will have access to
the initial input text, the generated answer, and all the intermediary
steps required to debug any potential issues using Opik’s
dashboard.
The last step is to attach the necessary metadata for your use case
to the current trace. As seen in the following code snippet, you can
easily do that by calling the update() method, where you can tag
your trace or add any other metadata, such as the number of input
tokens, through a Python dictionary:
from opik import track, opik_context
@track
def llm_chain(input_text):
# LLM chain code

## Page 797

# LLM chain code
# ...
opik_context.update_current_trace(
tags=["inference_pipeline"],
metadata={
"num_tokens": compute_num_tokens(…)
},
feedback_scores=[
{
"name": "user_feedback",
"value": 1.0,
"reason": "The response was valuable and c
},
{
"name": "llm_judge_score",
"value": compute_llm_judge_score(…),
"reason": "Computing runtime metrics using
}
)
You can expand on this idea and log various feedback scores. The
most common is asking the user if the generated answer is valuable
and correct. Another option is to compute various metrics
automatically through heuristics or LLM judges.
Finally, let’s see how to add prompt monitoring to our LLM Twin
project. First, look at Figure 11.21 and remember our model-serving

## Page 798

architecture. We have two microservices, the LLM and business
microservices. The LLM microservice has a narrow scope, as it only
takes as input a prompt that already contains the user’s input and
context and returns an answer that is usually post-processed. Thus,
the business microservice is the right place to implement the
monitoring pipeline, as it coordinates the end-to-end flow. More
concretely, Opik implementation will be in the FastAPI server
developed in Chapter 10.

## Page 799

Figure 11.21: Inference pipeline serving architecture
As our implementation is already modular, using Opik makes it
straightforward to log an end-to-end trace of a user’s request:

## Page 800

from opik import track
@track
def call_llm_service(query: str, context: str | No
llm = LLMInferenceSagemakerEndpoint(…)
answer = InferenceExecutor(llm, query, context
return answer
@track
def rag(query: str) -> str:
retriever = ContextRetriever()
documents = retriever.search(query, k=3 * 3)
context = EmbeddedChunk.to_context(documents)
answer = call_llm_service(query, context)
return answer
The rag() function represents your application’s entry point. All the
other processing steps take place in the ContextRetriever and
InferenceExector classes. Also, by decorating the
call_llm_service() function, we can clearly capture the prompt
sent to the LLM and its response.
To add more granularity to our trace, we can further decorate other
functions containing pre- or post-processing steps, such as the
ContextRetriever search function:

## Page 801

class ContextRetriever:
…
@track
def search(
self,
query: str,
k: int = 3,
expand_to_n_queries: int = 3,
) -> list:
query_model = Query.from_str(query)
query_model = self._metadata_extractor.gen
… # Rest of the implementation
Or even go further to the retrieval optimization methods, such as the
self-query metadata extractor, to add more granularity:
class SelfQuery:
@track
def generate(self, query: str) -> str:
…
return enhanced_query

## Page 802

The developer is responsible for deciding how much granularity the
application needs for proper debugging and analysis. As having
detailed monitoring is healthy, monitoring everything can be
dangerous as it adds too much noise and makes manually
understanding the traces difficult. You must find the right balance. A
good rule of thumb is tracing the most critical functions, such as
rag() and call_llm_service() , and gradually adding more
granularity when needed.
The last step is to attach valuable metadata and tags to our traces.
To do so, we will further enhance the rag() function as follows:
@track
def rag(query: str) -> str:
retriever = ContextRetriever()
documents = retriever.search(query, k=3 * 3)
context = EmbeddedChunk.to_context(documents)
answer, prompt = call_llm_service(query, conte
trace = get_current_trace()
trace.update(
tags=["rag"],
metadata={
"model_id": settings.HF_MODEL_ID,
"embedding_model_id": settings.TEXT_EMBEDDING_M
"temperature": settings.TEMPERATURE_INFERENCE,
"prompt_tokens": compute_num_tokens(prompt),
"total tokens": compute num tokens(answer)

## Page 803

total_tokens : compute_num_tokens(answer),
}
)
return answer
There are three main aspects that we should constantly monitor:
Model configuration: Here, we should consider both the LLM
and other models used within the RAG layer. The most critical
aspects of logging are the model IDs, but you can also capture
other important information that significantly impacts the
generation, such as the temperature.
Total number of tokens: It’s critical to constantly analyze the
statistics of the number of tokens generated by your input prompts
and total tokens, as this significantly impacts your serving costs.
For example, if the average of the total number of tokens
generated suddenly increases, it’s a strong signal that you have a
bug in your system that you should investigate.
The duration of each step: Tracking the duration of each step
within your trace is essential to finding bottlenecks within your
system. If the latency of a specific request is abnormally large,
you quickly have access to a report that helps you find the source
of the problem.

## Page 804

Alerting
Using ZenML, you can quickly implement an alerting system on any
platform of your liking, such as email, Discord, or Slack. For
example, you can add a callback in your training pipeline to trigger a
notification when the pipeline fails or the training has finished
successfully:
from zenml import get_pipeline_context, pipeline
@pipeline(on_failure=notify_on_failure)
def training_pipeline(…):
…
notify_on_success()
Implementing the notification functions is straightforward. As seen in
the code snippets below, you have to get the alerter instance
from your current stack, build the message as you see fit, and send it
to your notification channel of choice:
from zenml.client import Client
alerter = Client().active_stack.alerter
def notify_on_failure() -> None:
alerter.post(message=build_message(status=
@step(enable_cache=False)
def notify on success() -> None:

## Page 805

def notify_on_success() -> None:
alerter.post(message=build_message(status=
ZenML and most orchestrators simplify implementing an alerter ,
as it’s a critical component in your MLOps/LLMOps infrastructure.
Summary
In this chapter, we laid down the foundations with a theoretical
section on DevOps. Then, we moved on to MLOps and its core
components and principles. Finally, we presented how LLMOps
differs from MLOps by introducing strategies such as prompt
monitoring, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop feedback. Also, we
briefly discussed why most companies would avoid training LLMs
from scratch but choose to optimize them for their use case through
prompt engineering or fine-tuning. At the end of the theoretical
portion of the chapter, we learned what a CI/CD/CT pipeline is, the
three core dimensions of an ML application (code, data, model), and
that, after deployment, it is more critical than ever to implement a
monitoring and alerting layer due to model degradation.
Next, we learned how to deploy the LLM Twin’s pipeline to the cloud.
We understood the infrastructure and went step by step through
deploying MongoDB, Qdrant, the ZenML cloud, and all the
necessary AWS resources to sustain the application. Finally, we

## Page 806

learned how to Dockerize our application and push our Docker
image to AWS ECR, which will be used to execute the application on
top of AWS SageMaker.
The final step was to add LLMOps to our LLM Twin project. We
began by implementing a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. Then,
we looked at our CT strategy by leveraging ZenML.
Finally, we saw how to implement a monitoring pipeline using Opik
from Comet ML and an alerting system using ZenML. These are the
fundamental pillars in adding MLOps and LLMOps to any LLM-based
application.
The framework we learned about throughout the book can quickly be
extrapolated to other LLM applications. Even if we used the LLM
Twin use case as an example, most of the strategies applied can be
adapted to other projects. Thus, we can get an entirely new
application by changing the data and making minor tweaks to the
code. Data is the new oil, remember?
By finalizing this chapter, we’ve learned to build an end-to-end LLM
application, starting with data collection and fine-tuning until
deploying the LLM microservice and RAG service. Throughout this
book, we aimed to provide a thought framework to help you build

## Page 807

and solve real-world problems in the GenAI landscape. Now that you
have it, we wish you good luck in your journey and happy building!

Appendix
MLOps Principles
Building robust and scalable ML systems requires more than
creating powerful models. It demands an all-encompassing approach
to operationalizing the entire ML lifecycle. Let’s explore the six core
principles that guide the MLOps field. These principles are
independent of any tool and are at the core of building robust and
scalable ML systems. They provide a guideline for designing
production-ready applications, ensuring consistency, reliability, and
scalability at every stage.
With that in mind, let’s begin with the foundation: automation or
operationalization.
1. Automation or operationalization
To adopt MLOps, there are three core tiers that most applications
build up gradually, from manual processing to full automation:
Manual process: The process is experimental and iterative in the
early stages of developing an ML application. The data scientist
manually performs each pipeline step, such as data preparation
and validation, model training, and testing. At this point, they
commonly use Jupyter notebooks to train their models. This

## Page 811

stage’s output is the code used to prepare the data and train the
models.
Continuous training (CT): The next level involves automating
model training. This is known as continuous training, which
triggers model retraining whenever required. At this point, you
often automate your data and model validation steps. This step is
usually done by an orchestration tool, such as ZenML, that glues
all your code together and runs it on specific triggers. The most
common triggers are on a schedule, for example, every day or
when a specific event comes in, such as when new data is
uploaded or the monitoring system detects a drop in performance,
offering you the flexibility to adapt to various triggers.
CI/CD: In the final stage, you implement your CI/CD pipelines to
enable fast and reliable deployment of your ML code into
production. The key advancement at this stage is the automatic
building, testing, and deployment of data, ML models, and training
pipeline components. CI/CD is used to quickly push new code into
various environments, such as staging or production, ensuring
efficient and reliable deployment.
As we build our LLM system using the FTI (feature, training,
inference) architecture, we can quickly move from a manual process
to CI/CD/CT. In Figure A.1, we can observe that the CT process can
be triggered by various events, such as a drop in performance
detected by the monitoring pipeline or a batch of fresh data arriving.

## Page 812

Also, Figure A.1 is split into two main sections; the first one highlights
the automated processes, while at the bottom, we can observe the
manual processes performed by the data science team while
experimenting with various data processing methods and models.
Once they improve the model by tinkering with how the data is
processed or the model architecture, they push the code to the code
repository, which triggers the CI/CD pipeline to build, test, package,
and deploy the new changes to the FTI pipelines.

## Page 813

Figure A.1: CI/CD/CT on top of the FTI architecture
To conclude, CT automates the FTI pipelines, while CI/CD builds,
tests, and pushes new versions of the FTI pipeline code to
production.

## Page 814

2. Versioning
By now, we understand that the whole ML system changes if the
code, model, or data changes. Thus, it is critical to track and version
these three elements individually. But what strategies can we adopt
to track the code, model, and data separately?
The code is tracked by Git, which helps us create a new commit
(a snapshot of the code) on every change added to the codebase.
Also, Git-based tools usually allow us to make releases, which
typically pack multiple features and bug fixes. While the commits
contain unique identifiers that are not human-interpretable, a
release follows more common conventions based on their major,
minor, and patch versions. For example, in a release with version
“v1.2.3,” 1 is the major version, 2 is the minor version, and 3 is the
patch version. Popular tools are GitHub and GitLab.
To version the model, you leverage the model registry to store,
share, and version all the models used within your system. It
usually follows the same versioning conventions used in code
releases, defined as Semantic Versioning, which, along with the
major, minor, and patch versions, also supports alpha and beta
releases that signal applications. At this point, you can also
leverage the ML metadata store to attach information to the stored
model, such as what data it was trained on, its architecture,
performance, latency, and whatever else makes sense to your

## Page 815

specific use case. Doing so creates a clear catalog of models that
can easily be navigated across your team and company.
Versioning the data isn’t as straightforward as versioning the code
and model because it depends on the type of data you have
(structured or unstructured) and the scale of data you have (big or
small). For example, for structured data, you can leverage a SQL
database with a version column that helps you track the changes
in the dataset. However, other popular solutions are based on Git-
like systems, such as Data Version Control (DVC), that track
every change made to the dataset. Other trendy solutions are
based on artifacts similar to a model registry that allows you to
add a virtual layer to your dataset, tracking and creating a new
version for every change made to your data. Comet.ml, W&B
(Weights & Biases), and ZenML offer powerful artifact features.
For all solutions, you must store the data on-premises or use
cloud object storage solutions such as AWS S3. These tools
provide features that allow you to structure your datasets and
versions, track, and access them.
3. Experiment tracking
Training ML models is an entirely iterative and experimental process.
Unlike traditional software development, it involves running multiple
parallel experiments, comparing them based on a set of predefined
metrics, and deciding which one should advance to production. An

## Page 816

experiment tracking tool allows you to log all the necessary
information, such as metrics and visual representations of your
model predictions, to compare all your experiments and easily select
the best model. Popular tools are Comet ML, W&B, MLflow, and

4. Testing
The same trend is followed when testing ML systems. Hence, we
must test our application across all three dimensions: the data, the
model, and the code. We must also ensure that the feature, training,
and inference pipeline are well integrated with external services,
such as the feature store, and work together as a system. When
working with Python, the most common tool to write your tests is
pytest , which we also recommend.
Test types
In the development cycle, six primary types of tests are commonly
employed at various stages:
Unit tests: These tests focus on individual components with a
single responsibility, such as a function that adds two tensors or
one that finds an element in a list.
Integration tests: These tests evaluate the interaction between
integrated components or units within a system, such as the data

## Page 817

evaluation pipeline or the feature engineering pipeline, and how
they are integrated with the data warehouse and feature store.
System tests: System tests play a crucial role in the development
cycle as they examine the entire system, including the complete
and integrated application. These tests rigorously evaluate the
end-to-end functionality of the system, including performance,
security, and overall user experience—for example, testing an
entire ML pipeline, from data ingestion to model training and
inference, ensuring the system produces the correct outputs for
given inputs.
Acceptance tests: These tests, often called user acceptance
testing (UAT), are designed to confirm that the system meets
specified requirements, ensuring it is ready for deployment.
Regression tests: These tests check for previously identified
errors to ensure that new changes do not reintroduce them.
Stress tests: These tests evaluate the system’s performance and
stability under extreme conditions, such as high load or limited
resources. They aim to identify breaking points and ensure the
system can handle unexpected spikes in demand or adverse
situations without failing.

## Page 818

Figure A.2: Test types
We’ve intentionally left regression tests out of the preceding figure
because they aren’t a distinct testing phase. Instead, regression
testing is applied across all levels—unit, integration, system,
acceptance, and stress tests—to ensure that changes don’t
reintroduce previous errors. It’s an ongoing process within these
phases, not a separate type of test, which is why it’s not shown as a
separate category.
What do we test?

## Page 819

When writing most tests, you take a component and treat it as a
black box. Thus, what you have control over is the input and output.
You want to test that you get an expected output for a given input.
With that in mind, here are a few things you should usually test:
Inputs: Data types, format, length, and edge cases (min/max,
small/large, etc.)
Outputs: Data types, formats, exceptions, and intermediary and
final outputs
Test examples
When testing your code, you can leverage the standards from
classic software engineering. Here are a few examples of code tests
you can include when writing unit tests to get a better idea of what
we want to test at this point—for instance, you want to check that a
sentence is cleaned as expected.
Also, you can look at your chunking algorithm and assert that it
works properly by using various sentences and chunk sizes.
When we talk about data tests, we mainly refer to data validity. Your
data validity code usually runs when raw data is ingested from the
data warehouse or after computing the features. It is part of the
feature pipeline. Thus, by writing integration or system tests for your

## Page 820

feature pipeline, you can check that your system responds properly
to valid and invalid data.
Testing data validity depends a lot on your application and data type.
For example, when working with tabular data, you can check for non-
null values, that a categorical variable contains only the expected
values, or that a float value is always positive. You can check for
length, character encoding, language, special characters, and
grammar errors when working with unstructured data such as text.
Model tests are the trickiest, as model training is the most non-
deterministic process of an ML system. However, unlike traditional
software, ML systems can successfully complete without throwing
any errors. However, the real issue is that they produce incorrect
results that can only be observed during evaluations or tests. Some
standard model test techniques involve checking:
The shapes of the input and model output tensors
That the loss decreases after one batch (or more) of training
Overfit on a small batch, and the loss approaches 0
That your training pipeline works on all the supported devices,
such as the CPU and GPU
That your early stopping and checkpoint logic works

## Page 821

All the tests are triggered inside the CI pipeline. If some tests are
more costly, for example, the model ones, you can execute them
only on special terms, such as only when modifying the model code.
At the other end of the spectrum, you can also perform behavioral
testing on your model, which tries to adopt the strategy from code
testing and treats the model as a black box while looking solely at
the input data and expected outputs. This makes the behavioral
testing methods model agnostic. A fundamental paper in this area is
Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList,
which we recommend if you want to dig more into the subject.
However, as a quick overview, the paper proposes that you test your
model against three types of tests. We use a model that extracts the
main subject from a sentence as an example:
Invariance: Changes in your input should not affect the output—
for example, below is an example based on synonym injection:
model(text="The advancements in AI are changing
# output: ai
model(text="The progress in AI is changing the w
# output: ai
Directional: Changes in your input should affect the outputs—for
example, below is an example where we know the outputs should

## Page 822

change based on the provided inputs:
model(text="Deep learning used for sentiment ana
# output: deep-learning
model(text="Deep learning used for object detect
# output: deep-learning
model(text="RNNs for sentiment analysis.")
# output: rnn
Minimum functionality: The most simple combination of inputs
and expected outputs—for example, below is a set of simple
examples that we expect the model should always get right:
model(text="NLP is the next big wave in machine
# output: nlp
model(text="MLOps is the next big wave in machin
# output: mlops
model(text="This is about graph neural networks
# output: gnn
For more on testing, we recommend reading Testing

Models by Goku Mohandas:

5. Monitoring
Monitoring is vital for any ML system that reaches production.
Traditional software systems are rule-based and deterministic. Thus,
once it is built, it will always work as defined. Unfortunately, that is
not the case with ML systems. When implementing ML models, we
haven’t explicitly described how they should work. We have used
data to compile a probabilistic solution, which means that our ML
model will constantly be exposed to a level of degradation. This
happens because the data from production might differ from the data
the model was trained on. Thus, it is natural that the shipped model
doesn’t know how to handle these scenarios.
We shouldn’t try to avoid these situations but create a strategy to
catch and fix these errors in time. Intuitively, monitoring detects the
model’s performance degradation, which triggers an alarm that
signals that the model should be retrained manually, automatically, or
with a combination of both.
Why retrain the model? As the model performance degrades due to
a drift in the training dataset and what it inputs from production, the

## Page 824

only solution is to adapt or retrain the model on a new dataset that
captures all the new scenarios from production.
As training is a costly operation, there are some tricks that you can
perform to avoid retraining, but before describing them, let’s quickly
understand what we can monitor to understand our ML system’s
health.
Logs
The approach to logging is straightforward, which is to capture
everything, such as:
Document the system configurations.
Record the query, the results, and any intermediate outputs.
Log when a component begins, ends, crashes, and so on.
Ensure that each log entry is tagged and identified in a way that
clarifies its origin within the system.
While capturing all activities can rapidly increase the volume of logs,
you can take advantage of numerous tools for automated log
analysis and anomaly detection that leverage AI to efficiently scan all
the logs, providing you with the confidence to manage the logs
effectively.
Metrics

## Page 825

To quantify your application’s healthiness, you must define a set of
metrics. Each metric measures different aspects of your application,
such as the infrastructure, data, and model.
System metrics
The system metrics are based on monitoring service-level metrics
(latency, throughput, error rates) and infrastructure health
(CPU/GPU, memory). These metrics are used both in traditional
software and ML as they are crucial to understanding whether the
infrastructure works well and the system works as expected to
provide a good user experience to the end users.
Model metrics
Merely monitoring the system’s health won’t suffice to identify the
deeper issues within our model. Therefore, moving on to the next
layer of metrics that focus on the model’s performance is crucial.
This includes quantitative evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision,
and F1 score, as well as essential business metrics influenced by
the model, such as ROI and click rate.
Analyzing cumulative performance metrics over the entire
deployment period is often ineffective. Instead, evaluating
performance over time intervals relevant to our application, such as
hourly, is essential. Thus, in practice, you window your inputs and

## Page 826

compute and aggregate the metrics at the window level. These
sliding metrics can provide a clearer picture of the system’s health,
allowing us to detect issues more promptly without them being
obscured by historical data.
We may not always have access to ground-truth outcomes to
evaluate the model’s performance on production data. This is
particularly challenging when there is a significant delay or when
real-life data requires annotation. To address this issue, we can
develop an approximate signal to estimate the model’s performance
or label a small portion of our live dataset to assess performance.
When talking about ML monitoring, an approximate signal is also
known as a proxy metric, usually implemented by drift detection
methods, which are discussed in the following section.
Drifts
Drifts are proxy metrics that help us detect potential issues with the
production model in time without requiring any ground truths/labels.
Table A.1 shows three kinds of drifts.
What Description Drift formulation
drifts
Inputs (features)

## Page 827

Outputs (ground
truths/labels)
Table A.1: Relationship between data, model, and code changes
Data drift
Data drift, also called feature drift or covariate shift, occurs when the
distribution of the production data deviates from that of the training
data, as shown in Figure A.3. This difference means the model
cannot handle the changes in feature space, leading to potentially
unreliable predictions. Drift can result from natural real-life changes
or systemic problems like missing data, pipeline errors, and schema
modifications.

## Page 828

Figure A.3: Data drift examples
When data begins to drift, the degradation in our model’s
performance might not be immediately noticeable, particularly if the
model interpolates effectively. Nevertheless, this presents an ideal
chance to consider retraining before the drift affects the model’s
performance.
Target drift
In addition to changes in input data (data drift), we might also
encounter shifts in output distribution. The shift could involve
changes in the shape of the distribution or the addition and removal
of classes in categorical tasks. While retraining the model can help
reduce performance degradation due to target drift, you can often

## Page 829

prevent it by adapting the head processing steps and model head to
support the new schema of the output class.
For example, if you have a classifier that predicts if an image
contains animals or people, and you get a picture with buildings, you
can either adapt your model to support an unknown class or adjust
the head of the model to add the new class for future predictions.
Concept drift
In addition to changes in input and output data, their relationship can
also shift. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, makes our
model ineffective because the patterns it previously learned to
associate inputs with outputs become outdated. As illustrated in the
following figure, concept drifts can manifest in various ways:
Gradually over time
Suddenly, due to an external event
Periodically, due to recurring events

## Page 830

Figure A.4: Concept drift examples
For example, this happens when using the model in a different
geographic area. Let’s assume you want to build a model that
predicts whether a person will buy a specific car. You initially built it
for the American market. Now, you want to use it in the European
market, where people tend to buy smaller cars, creating a drift
between the size feature of the car and the output probability of
purchasing the vehicle. Of course, concept drifts can be more subtle
than this example.
All these types of drift can happen simultaneously,
complicating pinpointing the exact sources of drift.

## Page 831

How to detect and measure drifts
Now that we’ve recognized the various types of drift, it’s crucial to
understand how to detect and measure it. To do so, you need two
types of windows:
A reference window: This is the collection of data points used as
a baseline to compare against the production data distributions for
drift identification. It is usually gathered from the training dataset.
A test window: This collects data points gathered while the ML
system is in production. It is compared with the reference window
to ascertain if drift has occurred.
To measure the drifts, you leverage hypothesis tests that verify the
change in distribution between the two windows. For example, you
can use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to monitor a single
continuous feature. This is known as a univariate (1D) test. Thus,
you must run it for every feature you want to monitor. You can
leverage a chi-squared univariate test to monitor categorical
variables and determine if the frequency of events in production is
consistent with the reference window distribution.
from alibi_detect.cd import KSDrift
cd = KSDrift(X_ref, p_val=.05, preprocess_fn=prepr

## Page 832

When working with text data in an embedding representation, we
have to model a multivariate distribution, which is how LLMs work
with text. A popular approach is to take the embeddings of the test
and reference windows, apply a dimensionality reduction algorithm,
and apply an algorithm such as maximum mean discrepancy
(MMD). This algorithm is a kernel-based approach that measures the
distance between two distributions by computing the distance
between the mean of the embeddings of the two windows.
from alibi_detect.cd import MMDDrift
cd = MMDDrift(x_ref, backend='pytorch', p_val=.05)
preds = cd.predict(x)
Monitoring vs. observability
Monitoring involves the collection and visualization of data, whereas
observability provides insights into system health by examining its
inputs and outputs. For instance, monitoring allows us to track a
specific metric to detect potential issues.
On the other hand, a system is considered observable if it generates
meaningful data about its internal state, which is essential for
diagnosing root causes.

## Page 833

Alerts
Once we define our monitoring metrics, we need a way to get
notified. The most common approaches are to send an alarm in the
following scenarios:
A metric passes the values of a static threshold—for example,
when the accuracy of the classifier is lower than 0.8, send an
alarm.
Tweaking the p-value of the statistical tests that check for drifts. A
lower p-value means a higher confidence that the production
distribution differs from the reference one.
These thresholds and p-values depend on your application.
However, it is essential to find the correct values, as you don’t want
to overcrowd your alarming system with false positives. In that case,
your alarm system won’t be trustworthy, and you will either overreact
or not react at all to issues in your system. Some common channels
for sending alarms to your stakeholders are Slack, Discord, your
email, and PagerDuty. The system’s stakeholders can be the core
engineers, managers, or anyone interested in the system.
Depending on the nature of the alarm, you have to react differently.
But before taking any action, you should be able to inspect it and
understand what caused it. You should inspect what metric triggered

## Page 834

the alarm, with what value, the time it happened, and anything else
that makes sense to your application.
When the model’s performance degrades, the first impulse is to
retrain it. But that is a costly operation. Thus, you first have to check
that the data is valid, the schema hasn’t changed, and the data point
was not an isolated outlier. If neither is true, you should trigger the
training pipeline and train the model on the newly shifted dataset to
solve the drift.
6. Reproducibility
Reproducibility means that every process within your ML systems
should produce identical results given the same input. This has two
main aspects.
The first one is that you should always know what the inputs are—for
example, when training a model, you can use a plethora of
hyperparameters. Thus, you need a way to always track what assets
were used to generate the new assets, such as what dataset version
and config were used to train the model.
The second aspect is based on the non-deterministic nature of ML
processes. For example, when training a model from scratch, all the
weights are initially randomly initialized. Thus, even if you use the
same dataset and hyperparameters, you might end up with a model

## Page 835

with a different performance. This aspect can be solved by always
using a seed before generating random numbers, as in reality, we
cannot digitally create randomness, only pseudo-random numbers.
Thus, by providing a seed, we ensure that we always produce the
same trace of pseudo-random numbers. This can also happen at the
feature engineering step, in case we impute values with random
values or randomly remove data or labels. But as a general rule of
thumb, always try to make your processes as deterministic as
possible, and in case you have to introduce randomness, always
provide a seed that you have control over.
